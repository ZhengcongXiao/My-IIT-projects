the fulton county grand jury,said friday an investigation of,recent primary election produced no,evidence that any irregularities took,place the jury further said,in presentments that the city
executive committee which had charge,of the election deserves the,praise and thanks of the,city of atlanta for the,manner in which the election,was conducted the term jury
had been charged by fulton,superior court judge durwood pye,to investigate reports of possible,irregularities in the primary which,was won by ivan allen,only a relative handful of
such reports was received the,jury said considering the widespread,interest in the election the,number of voters and the,size of this city the,jury said it did find
that many of registration and,election laws are outmoded or,inadequate and often ambiguous it,recommended that fulton legislators act,to have these laws studied,and revised to the end
of modernizing and improving them,the grand jury commented on,a number of other topics,among them the atlanta and,fulton county purchasing departments which,it said are well operated
and follow generally accepted practices,which inure to the best,interest of both governments merger,proposed however the jury said,it believes these two offices,should be combined to achieve
greater efficiency and reduce the,cost of administration the city,purchasing department the jury said,is lacking in experienced clerical,personnel as a result of,city personnel policies it urged
that the city take steps,to remedy this problem implementation,of automobile title law was,also recommended by the outgoing,jury it urged that the,next legislature provide enabling funds

for child welfare services in,foster homes this is one,of the major items in,the fulton county general assistance,program the jury said but,the state welfare department has
seen fit to distribute these,funds through the welfare departments,of all the counties in,the state with the exception,of fulton county which receives,none of this money the
jurors said they realize a,proportionate distribution of these funds,might disable this program in,our less populous counties nevertheless,we feel that in the,future fulton county should receive
some portion of these available,funds the jurors said failure,to do this will continue,to place a disproportionate burden,on fulton taxpayers the jury,also commented on the fulton
court which has been under,fire for its practices in,the appointment of appraisers guardians,and administrators and the awarding,of fees and compensation wards,protected the jury said it
found the court has incorporated,into its operating procedures the,recommendations of two previous grand,juries the atlanta bar association,and an interim citizens committee,these actions should serve to
protect in fact and in,effect the wards from undue,costs and its appointed and,elected servants from unmeritorious criticisms,the jury said regarding new,airport the jury recommended that
when the new management takes,charge the airport be operated,in a manner that will,eliminate political influences the jury,did not elaborate but it,added that there should be
