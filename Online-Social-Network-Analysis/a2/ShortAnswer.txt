1. Looking at the top errors printed by get_top_misclassified, name two ways you would modify your classifier to improve accuracy (it could be features, tokenization, or something else.)


Our classifier does not detect irony or negation. A way to fix would be to use to ngram model. A quick way to take word dependencies into account would be to append features including the context around the word.


2. Implement one of the above methods. How did it affect the results?
