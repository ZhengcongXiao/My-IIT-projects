Overall a promising topic. For twitter, there is a way to get the retweets of a tweet. You'd then need to separate the RT itself from the additional commentary. One challenge is that I expect most RTs will have no additional commentary. 
You could also search explicitly for URLs that link to fake news (from your referenced datasets).

I think emoji's will be important here, so representing them properly will help. Eg, https://github.com/carpedm20/emoji/blob/master/emoji/core.py#L55

You may also look at the number of believers/non-believers as a function of the fact checking score (e.g., does a politifact score of "Pants on Fire" have more non-believers than one of "Mostly False"?)
