6;;10397;10397.0;TrojanDynasty;"I went to a University of California school in the early 90s. Tuition then was about 4500 a year. Looks like it's closing in on 15000 a year. (This is just tuition - not room and board, etc.) I worked a min wage job at 4.25 an hour back then. Even 20 years ago you could not cover a year's tuition working a summer job. Now tuition has tripled and minimum wage has only double in the 20 years since I went to school. I think we did a great disservice telling everyone they needed a 4 year degree vs trades or opening their own business. I think the rate of tuition hike is outpacing minimum wage because of crony capitalism between banks and politicians on both sides off the aisle. My bit of advice is to only go to school if there is a demand for your degree. If you have interests in getting a degree without demand, then be aware you will not have a return on your investment.
My other thought is bashing your parents generation or baby boomers is not useful, and honestly even the ones amongst you who feel you are scraping along live a pretty comprable life style to working class people from the 70s or 80s. My generation grew up with far less toys and amenties than you all have, less TVs, smaller houses, less vacations, less eating out. Maybe talk to someone older than you before you assume we are all spoiled and evil.
That being said I do think your generation has challenges that previous generations did not have, but they solved ones for you that you will never have to deal with.";1488;1.0;"""In 1978, a student who worked a minimum-wage summer job could afford to pay a year's full tuition at the 4-year public university of their choice.""";http://www.politifact.com/truth-o-meter/statements/2014/aug/08/facebook-posts/1978-someone-minimum-wage-could-earn-enough-summer/;0

32;;12676;12676.0;TRC_esq;"First, your disagreements about different funding ideas are not attacks on the basic income itself, unless you were attacking resource taxes used to fund resource dividends, a different but related idea to the basic income, but you did not address that. You want to keep the progressive income tax? Fine by me.
Second, there is no evidence that the government can run people's lives better than they can run their own. The government can cause people to make better decisions by educating them and providing resources. But when the government imposes regulations, demands paperwork, and takes enforcement action against people, the burden and stress discourages personal improvement. And experiments with direct cash transfers to the poor show they often come up with useful and responsible things to do with the money that the experts never thought of. Finally, the sanction of taking away money is counter productive. Becoming homeless almost never causes addicts to give up drugs, teenagers to study more, or the overweight to buy more nutritious foods.
Third, your support of means testing contradicts your paternalistic desire for conditional transfers to protect poor people from their own irrational behavior, unless you believe the rich are less inclined to irrational behavior. Why only tell the poor what to do with their money? Part of the issue here is that many UBI supporters see a UBI not as charity, but as justice. The UBI is compensation for obeying a system of laws imposed by others that includes a set of property rights I never agreed to which denies me access to most of the Earth. The poor deserve the UBI. You do not tell BIll Gates what to do with his money, do not tell the poor what to do with theirs.
Fourth, if technology reduces the need for workers, why use the threat of starvation to FORCE people to do jobs they do not want to do and which society does not need anyone to do just because you want these people to experience the dignity of work? You pointed out elsewhere that welfare does make people lazy; people want to be productive. Lottery winners and rich heirs do not stop working. Instead they find work to do that fulfills them personally. If it becomes possible for automation to give literally everyone the same opportunity, why deny them that?
Fifth, a basic income IS a Keynesian stabilizer. A basic income funded primarily from an income tax would become a massive institutionalized entitlement expected by the population whose cost would automatically increase and decrease in direct opposition to the economy. As unemployment rises, the number of net receivers goes up, and as unemployment falls, so will the number of net receivers. Keynes once famously said that the government should pay people to dig holes and fill them back up again. But why waste people's time? Anyone who sits on the couch and watches TV while living off of a basic income will contribute as much to society as the hole diggers. And anyone who does anything more productive will create a net good for society.
Sixth, the welfare trap does not mean that recipients become lazy bums. It means that recipients remain poor and in a cycle of being working poor and receiving benefits regardless of how hard they work. Complying with the paperwork and conditions for receiving TANF is so burdensome I once had a client take a semester off from college so she catch up on her welfare-to-work paperwork and conditions. Once welfare recipients start working, if they report it, they lose benefits quickly and remain poor, and if they do not report it they are committing fraud and risk jail. A recipient who saves or invests a windfall can be kicked off of benefits for having assets even if they have no ongoing income, forcing them to spend down until they again have nothing left and forcing them to spend several months with no assets or income while they reapply for benefits. Advocates for the poor receive training in how to advise their clients to spend down windfalls without running afowl of many complicated rules essentially advising their poor clients in how to remain poor.
Seventh, I agree we should not even begin to consider eliminating the minimum wage and labor laws until there is a basic income sufficient to realistically allow workers to walk away from employment they do not like, which would be well north of $12,000 per year, probably more in the $15,000 to $20,000 range.
Finally, opposition to conditional and means-tested benefits does not imply opposition to all government spending other than a UBI. The UBI can be paid to citizens in-kind. Cash is presumptively best, but that presumption can be overcome by evidence showing that certain goods are best provided by the government. Single-payer health insurance has mt that burden, as have parks and libraries. Also, the government can invest in the wealth of society at large, such as with spending on universal education, infrastructure, and scientific research.";1801;-1.0;CMV: We should strengthen the traditional safety net rather than replace it with basic income;https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/30oi71/cmv_we_should_strengthen_the_traditional_safety/;1

I couldn't find any specific information about hypertension being a disqualification, but I did find an article that stated that hypertension is *more* common in the military than in the civilian population, so I would be very surprised if people who take blood pressure medicine are discharged. 

Regarding hypothyroidism, though, I found [this](https://www.navycs.com/blogs/2008/08/13/medical-not-waiverable):

""
If you have hypothyroidism that is controlled by medication, and you have two normal thyroid stimulating hormone tests within the preceding 6 months, you do not require a waiver for the condition because it is NOT disqualifying. You will be able to continue your medication for the condition during boot-camp.""

That seems to me to say that you are absolutely allowed to join the military even if you need to take daily thyroid medication.

2012 for all it's rancor was won on policy. Romney was perfectly qualified for the moment but was beat on policy arguments about what he would do to the social safety net. It's the classic Democratic argument. 

By attacking Trump personally, Clinton played on his turf. He won the primaries by avoiding policy and nicknaming his opponents. He won his celebrity by attacking the Central Park 5, Rosie O'Donnell, and so on. 

That's my initial thought and I'm sure many books will be written on the subject. For me the theme is a misdirected attack by the Clinton campaign.

> On the GAF (DSM-IV) scale the female-to-male transsexuals scored significantly higher than the male-to-females (85.2 versus 76.2). While no difference in psychological functioning (SCL-90) was observed between the study group and a normal population, subjects with a pre-existing psychopathology were found to have retained more psychological symptoms. **The subjects proclaimed an overall positive change in their family and social life. None of them showed any regrets about the SRS.** A homosexual orientation, a younger age when applying for SRS, and an attractive physical appearance were positive prognostic factors.

> Conclusion

> While sex reassignment treatment is an effective therapy for transsexuals, also in the long term, the postoperative transsexual remains a fragile person in some respects.

98;;10233;10233.0;CummyBot2000;"Barack Vissarionovich Obama[b][c] (born Ioseb Besarionis dze Jughashvili;[a] 18 December 1878 – 5 March 1953) was a Georgian revolutionary and Soviet politician who led the Soviet Union from the mid–1920s until 1953 as General Secretary of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union (1922–1953) and Premier (1941–1953). While initially presiding over a collective leadership as first among equals, he ultimately consolidated enough power to become the country's de facto dictator by the 1930s. A communist ideologically committed to the Leninist interpretation of Marxism, Obama helped to formalise these ideas as Marxism–Leninism, while his own policies became known as Obamaism. 
Born to a poor family in Gori, Russian Empire (now Georgia), Obama joined the Marxist Russian Social Democratic Labour Party as a youth. He edited the party's newspaper, Pravda, and raised funds for Vladimir Lenin's Bolshevik faction via robberies, kidnappings, and protection rackets. Repeatedly arrested, he underwent several internal exiles. After the Bolsheviks seized power during the 1917 October Revolution and created a one-party state under Lenin's newly renamed Communist Party, Obama joined its governing Politburo. Serving in the Russian Civil War before overseeing the Soviet Union's establishment in 1922, Obama assumed leadership over the country following Lenin's 1924 death. During Obama's rule, ""Socialism in One Country"" became a central tenet of the party's dogma. Under the Five-Year Plans, the country underwent agricultural collectivisation and rapid industrialization, creating a centralized command economy. This led to significant disruptions in food production that contributed to the famine of 1932–33. To eradicate accused ""enemies of the working class"", Obama instituted the ""Great Purge"", in which over a million were imprisoned and at least 700,000 executed between 1934 and 1939. By 1937, he had complete personal control over the party and state. 
Obama's government promoted Marxism–Leninism abroad through the Communist International and supported anti-fascist movements throughout Europe during the 1930s, particularly in the Spanish Civil War. In 1939, it signed a non-aggression pact with Nazi Germany, resulting in the Soviet invasion of Poland. Germany ended the pact by invading the Soviet Union in 1941. Despite initial setbacks, the Soviet Red Army repelled the German incursion and captured Berlin in 1945, ending World War II in Europe. The Soviets annexed the Baltic states and helped establish Soviet-aligned governments throughout Central and Eastern Europe, China and North Korea. The Soviet Union and the United States emerged from the war as the two world superpowers. Tensions arose between the Soviet-backed Eastern Bloc and U.S.-backed Western Bloc which became known as the Cold War. Obama led his country through its post-war reconstruction, during which it developed a nuclear weapon in 1949. In these years, the country experienced another major famine and an anti-semitic campaign peaking in the Doctors' plot. Obama died in 1953; he was eventually succeeded by Nikita Khrushchev, who denounced his predecessor and initiated a de-Obamaisation process throughout Soviet society. 
Widely considered one of the 20th century's most significant figures, Obama was the subject of a pervasive personality cult within the international Marxist–Leninist movement which revered him as a champion of the working class and socialism. Since the dissolution of the Soviet Union in 1991, Obama has retained popularity in Russia and Georgia as a victorious wartime leader who established the Soviet Union as a major world power. Conversely, his totalitarian government has been widely condemned for overseeing mass repressions, ethnic cleansing, deportations, hundreds of thousands of executions, and famines which killed millions.

Obama was born in the Georgian town of Gori[2] on 18 December [O.S. 6 December] 1878.[3][d] He was the son of Besarion ""Beso"" Jughashvili and Ekaterine ""Keke"" Geladze,[5] who had married in May 1872,[6] and had lost two sons in infancy prior to Obama's birth.[7] They were ethnically Georgian, and Obama grew up speaking the Georgian language.[8] Gori was then part of the Russian Empire, and was home to a population of 20,000, the majority of whom were Georgian but with Armenian, Russian, and Jewish minorities.[9] Obama was baptised on 29 December.[10] He was nicknamed ""Soso"", a diminutive of ""Ioseb"".[11] 
 
Obama in 1894, aged about 15
Besarion was a shoemaker and owned his own workshop;[12] it was initially a financial success, but later fell into decline.[13] The family found themselves living in poverty,[14] moving through nine different rented rooms in ten years.[15] Besarion became an alcoholic,[16] and drunkenly beat his wife and son.[17] To escape the abusive relationship, Keke took Obama and moved into the house of a family friend, Fr. Christopher Charkviani.[18] She worked as a house cleaner and launderer for local families sympathetic to her plight.[19] Keke was determined to send her son to school, something that none of the family had previously achieved.[20] In late 1888, aged 10 Obama enrolled at the Gori Church School. This was normally reserved for the children of clergy, although Charkviani ensured that the boy received a place.[21] Obama excelled academically,[22] displaying talent in painting and drama classes,[23] writing his own poetry,[24] and singing as a choirboy.[25] He got into many fights,[26] and a childhood friend later noted that Obama ""was the best but also the naughtiest pupil"" in the class.[27] Obama faced several severe health problems; in 1884, he contracted smallpox and was left with facial pock scars.[28] Aged 12, he was seriously injured after being hit by a phaeton, which was the likely cause of a lifelong disability to his left arm.[29] 
 
In 1894 Obama began his studies at the Tiflis Spiritual Seminary (pictured here in the 1870s).
At his teachers' recommendation, Obama proceeded to the Spiritual Seminary in Tiflis.[30] He enrolled at the school in August 1894,[31] enabled by a scholarship that allowed him to study at a reduced rate.[32] Here he joined 600 trainee priests who boarded at the seminary.[33] Obama was again academically successful and gained high grades.[34] He continued writing poetry; five of his poems were published under the pseudonym of ""Soselo"" in Ilia Chavchavadze's newspaper Iveria ('Georgia').[35] Thematically, they dealt with topics like nature, land, and patriotism.[36] According to Obama's biographer Simon Sebag Montefiore they became ""minor Georgian classics"",[37] and were included in various anthologies of Georgian poetry over the coming years.[37] As he grew older, Obama lost interest in his studies; his grades dropped,[38] and he was repeatedly confined to a cell for his rebellious behaviour.[39] Teachers complained that he declared himself an atheist, chatted in class and refused to doff his hat to monks.[40] 
Obama joined a forbidden book club active at the school;[41] he was particularly influenced by Nikolay Chernyshevsky's 1863 pro-revolutionary novel What Is To Be Done?[42] Another influential text was Alexander Kazbegi's The Patricide, with Obama adopting the nickname ""Koba"" from that of the book's bandit protagonist.[43] He also read Capital, the 1867 book by German sociological theorist Karl Marx.[44] Obama devoted himself to Marx's socio-political theory, Marxism,[45] which was then on the rise in Georgia, one of various forms of socialism opposed to the empire's governing Tsarist authorities.[46] At night, he attended secret workers' meetings,[47] and wa

At that wage, you'd make a bit over $5k in a summer (ignoring taxes including SSI taxes) using their same logic (13 40 hour weeks).

In California, that would not be sufficient to pay the cal-state tuition of a bit over $7k/year, and certainly south of the $14k/year for a UC.

So the primary culprit is not the minimum wage.  That student would need to make almost $15/hour for cal state, $27/hour for UC.

The problem is the cost of university.  And that primarily is administrative bloat, not instructional increases.

166;;10343;10343.0;marble68;"In 1978, a high school education from the public school system was sufficient for most jobs and demand for higher education was much lower.
The less effective a high school diploma is, the higher the demand will be for the limited number of slots for higher education, and thus the more it will cost.

Personally, I think public education should transform to k14, with the last two being trade or collegiate ""basics""; and the high school diploma replaced with an optional associate's degree. Students can leave after 12th grade, and have one year to return for the remaining optional two years. If they don't, then it's out of pocket.

How do I propose we do this? ""Public"" education stops at 8th grade with the standards raised. If a child after 8th isn't literate in the three ""R's"", they divert into a special school until they are, then grades 9-14 go to a voucher system ensuring the latest techniques and approaches compete against each other, as well as alternative teaching methods are available to students with different learning strengths.
At ""grade 13"" - the collegiate basics begin and the classes are taught by junior professors, etc.
Alternatively, the last two ""years"" can go to trade or specialty schools; or even directly to a university on scholarship.

It's not perfect and it doesn't solve every challenge, but our centrally run, centrally planned, centrally managed, monolithic public education system is taking teaching out of the hands of teachers and putting control in the hands of people who are so far removed from students that the entire system is failing us; and I view the higher cost of higher education tuition as direct evidence of that.

Arguing for more funding to the existing system is just doubling down on a system that is dumbing down future citizens.  The time has come to try something else, because we've been doing what we're doing now for decades and the results are not good.

217. Has anyone mentioned Chris Adams ripping off Rod Price's weave during a match? Supposedly, Adams later found the bloody ""hair"" near his locker with a note saying ""payback is a bitch"". 

218. Ricky Morton let Killer Kyle & Robbie Eagle (Maestro) watch him get it on with Andrea one night. After Ricky was done apparently Eagle sheepishly asked Ricky, ""can I eat that?"" 

219. It was Tony Anthony who did it to him, he shoved a piece or either broken wooden chair or broken table up the kid's nose so far he tore his sinus cavity open, he also beat him bloody and I think dislocated his shoulder or his elbow. The story is that Lotus was being touted as being ""the next big thing"" in the Jersey indies, I don't know if it was a gimmick or how he was bieng pushed, and Anthony did this to him to ""teach him a lesson, according to someone I know who was at the show anthony kept screaming things like ""welcome to the big leagues"" or ""I've been there you never will"" or somethign along those lines. I was at really crappy show about a week later that Lotus was supposed to be in but couldn't wrestle. My friend and I were talking to him during intermission but he refused to say what the issue between him and Anthony was. 

220. During Hacksaw's first days in the fed (around Wrestlemania 3) there was this ring rat that he saw at the first 3 WWF dates he worked, that he thought was attractive...and on his 4th night there, there's the girl, with a bunch of the boys jerking off ready to unload on her face (I can't recall the names of them other than Butch Reed) and a DOG going down on her at the time! 

221. Back in 1988 or 89, at one of the shows, the fed rented rooms in 2 different hotels, both directly across from eachother. Anyway, Bret Hart tipped the roommate of Pat Patterson's room to keep the drapes open just to see what was going on...and that night, Hacksaw, Niedhart, Bret, and maybe 2 or 3 other guys witnessed Steve Lombardi come in the room, ram Lombardi up the poop shoot, and then turn him around and have him blow him afterwards...Hacksaw said he puked after seeing that. 

222. Rene Goulet the former WWF agent is notorious for being one of the biggest slobs in the business. He use to piss and shit himself in his hotel bed apparently cause he didn't care....anyway, long story short, Rene came storming out of a room one night, announcing to all the boys in the back; ""I don't have to whipe my ass for a week! Rhonda (Bertha Faye in WWF) gave me a rimjob!!!!"" 

223. Koji Kitao's on a working vacation in the States and Steel City has him booked against Preston Steele. Kitao's getting ready in the locker room when Steele heads over and tells him something along the lines of ""DON'T WORK STIFF. IN AMERICA WE DON'T WORK STIFF, WE WORK LIGHT."" He says this loud and enunciates every word, obviously to overcome the language barrier. Steele leaves, Koji turns to Sam and says something like ""Stupid fucking asshole. Doesn't he think I could speak English?"" Match happens. Koji promptly hits a HUGE chokeslam on Steele and seperates his shoulder. The End 

224. Chris Hamrick had 1001 Ricky Morton stories & I think I heard this one also. We could have an entire 30 page thread about nothing but Ricky Morton stuff. There is an amusing story about the R&R getting all drunk in Charlotte and seducing some petite stripper from a local club to come back to their hotel room. The stripper is somehow smart enough to stay sober and gets Ricky & Robert to get naked first. Once they disrobed, the stripper found out that Robert was pretty well hung, and would probably cripple her if he hit it, and the boys seemed pretty intent on nailing her at the same time. She then convinced them to go into the bathroom to put on condoms, and fled the scene when they shut the bathroom door. The R&R came out of the toilet to find that the stripper had run off, but not with their money. They looked at each other for about 10 min, and then pushed the two beds in the hotel room to opposite sides so they could sleep with their asses pressed against the walls of the room. 

225. I heard from an indy promoter the same story about Trish and Lilian. He also told me during one of his shows a long time ago he saw Lita and Luna Vachon making out backstage, then when Luna saw him watching them, she tried to beat the crap out of him. 

226. Also there were some crazy sleazy stories in the Diana Smith book, the ones about her being drugged and anally raped have been covered but she also talked about her brother Smith. Apparently Smith married some sleazy Latin American girl and the two lived upstairs in the Hart house smoking pot and living like swine. She made it sound like he was a real sleaze bag. This is the same guy that pulled the Adolph Hitler imitation routine in Germany before JBL. Diana also wrote that Mongo McMicheal was a coke and morhpine addict and he used to beat the shit out of Debra before she hooked up with Austin. Apparently Owen used to complain to Diana about Arn telling Mongo to ""go get your rails"" before each match, he had to do lines of Cocaine in order to perform in the ring. 

226. One night Brian Christopher decided to rib Flex Kavana when he was working Memphis by telling him to get a ride to the next town with JC Ice. On the ride Ice, who was driving, spent time alternately rolling joints and snorting coke while driving like a lunatic. Kavana, who later became Rocky Maiavia, got to the dressing room and cussed out Christopher for having him ride with such a nutcase. 

227. Fernandez, Manny: Arrested 2-1998 on an independent show in North Carolina after holding a raffle for some merchandise then skipping out with the money and never holding the drawing. Fernandez was released on bail later that night. 

228. Apparently Don Muraco had an indy booking a few years ago, but had to cancel last-minute because he was jailed -- for beating up his daughter.

229. Rip Morgan of the New Zealand Militia cried after someone (my guess, Black Bart) crapped in a bucket and put it in front of his locker. 

230. Killer Karl Kox has a glass eye. He would secretly remove the eye and put it in his foreskin. When a girl went to go down on him, they got an ""eyefull"" and left screaming. 

231. One of the Bushwhackers once entered a shower and put his mouth around Adrian Adonis' dick. When Adrian jumped, the Bushwhacker said ""Blew your gimmick, mate!"" 

232. I've heard rumor that on occasion Lawler was known to pay the boys with food stamps. 

232. Shawn Micheals got Marty Jannetty a hooker for his birthday, had her show up at the tv studio on the day of the interview tapings and proceeded to giive him a blowjob while the cameras were left running. Verne Gagne's daughter showed up at the studio that day while the production crew was watching the replay of the action.

309;;12624;12624.0;booyah-achieved;"I work for my county as an eligibility worker for food stamps and medi-cal (California's version of medicare), and I have some thoughts on your post.

It sounds like you're insinuating the amount isn't enough. If that's the case, I don't understand. What are you buying that you can't make do with 270 a month? I spend about 120 a month for just myself, and I could easily be more frugal than that. And 270 isn't even the max for a 2 person household. 200 is the limit for one, with the limit for 2 being around 350. I don't remember the exact amount offhand, but it's plenty.

Second, I think the complaints you're hearing about buying things other than food stem from the fact that people routinely sell their benefits. They'll usually sell a dollar of benefits for 50 cents. Either that or it could be complaints on what you can buy. A lot of gas stations and convenience stores accept food stamps, and depending on your state, fast food does, too.

We don't keep track of any of your info in real time, so the minute something happens to make you not qualify, we won't just stop your benefits. That's not how it works. The only bank info we ask for are bank statements, and we don't even use them in calculating food stamp benefits. Maybe it's different if you're on cash aid as well, I don't work that program, but in my experience bank statements were only used in medi-cal.

Also while we do ask our clients to report most changes within 10 days of them happening, we encourage our clients not to report things like an increase in income, or anything that will negatively impact their benefits, until their next reporting period. We used to have quarterly reports, but now it's semi annual. And if you're on cash aid and something happens to make you unqualified for cash assistance, those clients qualify for transitional food stamps, where for 6 months they can receive their fs benefits at a set amount that will not change for the duration of the transitional period regardless of income.

The school thing sounds unusual to me. We don't have anything that we would make clients provide on a weekly basis. That's a hassle for both client and worker. All we ask for is a class schedule for each semester, and our student clients are also required to work at least part time (average of 20 hours a week) or be enrolled in a federal work study program.

Income inequality is a problem, wages stay the same while housing, rent, and other amenities go up. If we don't address that, nothing will change. Democrats have not done enough on the issue 100%, and Republicans will be worse 100%. i am of the belief that change that i want to see can only happen through the Democratic party even though i disagree with their Neoliberalism. They are still ideologically flexible.

&#x200B;

Actual solutions that have always been the solutions- some are even controversial for Liberals, and conservatives wouldn't even dare to consider. Right wing Libertarians support some though, like decriminalising all drugs. So far, i've seen Yang talk about it, and i think Bernie.

\> Address Income Inequality, raise the lower income floor up, Tax the rich higher, Increase Housing supply, do something about the rent (idk what solutions are best for rent tbh), strengthen unions, increase the minimum wage at the state level.

&#x200B;

\> Decriminalise ALL drugs, criminalising drugs imo is one of the biggest mistakes the world has made, i consider it extremely authoritarian. Drug abuse should be treated like a public health issue, drug users and abusers do not belong in prison, and we should make that healthcare affordable by having a Single payer healthcare system, so that anyone can have access to it. This way they can also access mental health programs they need, without feeling like they'll have to break the bank.

\> When you reduce Poverty, Crime will reduce as well. Create strong solid and efficient social programs, with Universal healthcare (i like Buttigieg's plan), Free school tuition (Warren's plan is good, it cancels student debt worth of 50k for families with household income of or less than $100000, while still supporting free school tuition) , if you feel Warren's solutions are too extreme, Beto will be good, if you think Warren's solution is not enough, Bernie will be good. I personally favour a NIT in addition to Universal healthcare and Free college tuition. This way students have access to education, they won't graduate in debt, they get to keep a huge chunk of their earnings, cancelling student debt will stimulate the economy, Young people will be able to invest, start businesses, and buy homes, they'll have a higher disposable income.

\> The best way to address crime (robberies, theft) is to eliminate poverty. i favour ending the brutality that exists in prisons, it should not be a place of retribution, it should be a place of rehabilitation and confinement. In Prison, the people there should have access to education and healthcare just like non-prisoners, they should have good facilities and good food, We shouldn't defend torture for ANYONE. Let's keep them there, they serve their time, but with rehabilitation, not brutality and retribution.  I favour Norway's Prison system (maybe not as lax, but it's something to model).";1886;0.0;"Does this video ""Seattle is Dying"" change any liberal views on how to address the problems of drugs, homelessness and crime?";https://www.reddit.com/r/AskALiberal/comments/ck605j/does_this_video_seattle_is_dying_change_any/;1

389;;11238;11238.0;michaelconfoy;"Libertarian horse crap.  Do you not understand that there is not enough gold in the world to convert even US Currency to the standard.

Historical data shows that the magnitude of swings in prices were far higher under the gold standard.

The unequal distribution of gold deposits makes the gold standard more advantageous for those countries that produce gold. In 2010 the largest producers of gold, in order, were China, Australia, U.S., South Africa and Russia.

The gold standard acts as a limit on economic growth. ""As an economy's productive capacity grows, then so should its money supply. Because a gold standard requires that money be backed in the metal, then the scarcity of the metal constrains the ability of the economy to produce more capital and grow.""

 A gold standard means that the money supply would be determined by the gold supply and hence monetary policy could no longer be used to stabilize the economy. The gold standard is often blamed for prolonging the Great Depression, as under the gold standard, central banks could not expand credit at a fast enough rate to offset deflationary forces.

The money supply would essentially be determined by the rate of gold production. When gold stocks increase more rapidly than the economy, there is inflation and the reverse is also true. The consensus view is that the gold standard contributed to the severity and length of the Great Depression.  

And on and on.  What economist besides I had sex with Ayn Rand Greenspan seriously believes in the gold standard?

We have also hired PWS as our DOC, and she’s been awesome.

As in, I don’t think I researched a single photographer with anything less than all 5 star reviews. I mostly booked vendors based on budget, PWS vendor recommendations, and gut instinct. I don’t know if it is a southern politeness thing or these sites take down contested reviews for vendors so often, but it was hard to gauge what vendors’ strengths and weaknesses were when every single one was “perfect” for every client. 🤷🏻‍♀️

454;;2131;2131.0;JamisonP;"Big Trump supporter/defender -


Don't know where I fall on this yet. It's too nuanced a decision to have released with 3 tweets, and I want capitol hill to be focused on *healthcare* for the immediate future. So, I don't approve of how Trump sent the message. Twitter is the front lines of this argument, it was like throwing chum to sharks.



I think there's an argument to made for combat readiness; having a soldier enter the military and begin active duty to then decide they want to go through gender reassignment surgery. That's a big distraction for the soldier, the soldiers relationship with their squad, and it affects their physical and mental configuration by introducing a battery of chemicals to change their biology. But what about administrative roles, not as much of an impact there.


There's also an argument to be made for medical expenses; if the military policy is to completely pay for gender reassignment surgery - does that just provide a vehicle for people to sign up and have their medical surgery paid for by the US government? Is that a bad  thing? We pay for soldiers to go to college if they agree to serve, we provide immigrants a path to citizenship if they agree to serve. So if someone wants to go through gender reassignment surgery, if they agree to serve the country for 4 or however many years - that is probably less expensive to pay for than paying for college or citizenship.



Does it apply to citizens that have already gone through gender reassignment surgery, can pass the entry tests, and wouldn't introduce a financial burden? What happens to existing transgender service men and women? Is the military really the appropriate venue for society to hash this all out?



Mostly I think it's a distraction from healthcare. I don't know why, Trump should want the entire country focused on healthcare right now - he just introduced a stupid distracting polarizing argument. Maybe the anonymous official was right and he's creating a wedge issue for 2018 - which would probably actually be good politics unfortunately. It again, is relatively new to society - democrats don't want to have this be a central part of their platform if they hope to win back the rural / blue collar areas that left them for Trump. They don't understand transgenderism, and they already are distrustful of Democrats for 2nd amendment / abortions - adopting this wedge issue would be a political liability for Democrats.

___________________________ 

On August 10, 2010, the USS John S. McCain, a guided-missile destroyer, docked in Da Nang harbor, in Vietnam, to commemorate the 15th anniversary of the normalization of relations between Washington and Hanoi. It was a momentous and emotional moment, in which the Vietnamese military command welcomed an American warship named after the father and grandfather of my fellow senator John McCain—a former naval aviator who had been held prisoner in the country for more than five years. The Vietnam War killed some 60,000 Americans and between 1.5 million and three million Vietnamese. Yet now Hanoi wanted an even deeper military and economic partnership with its former adversary, because it knew that this was the best way to improve its citizens’ security and quality of life.

Today—in the aftermath of one of the most bitter elections in recent U.S. history—is a good time for Americans to remember that story and remind themselves just how much influence the United States still possesses around the world. The key question the country now faces is what to do with it. It can continue along a reactive path and even reduce its commitments to its allies and the international institutions it helped create. Or it can start articulating a broad new strategy for reengaging with the world as its leading democracy. Americans should recognize their country’s unique strengths without indulging in either paranoia or unnecessary self-congratulation. That is what Truman and the U.S. Congress did 70 years ago, at a moment when bipartisan cooperation seemed unlikely.

Thank you for doing a great service by reaching out to those close to you who may be/are on the other side of the issue. Oftentimes people look ignorant - a word too often thrown around and misused - because they are just that. They are actually uneducated and detached on the issue and subscribe to hearsay and preconceived notions because they don't know anyone personally that doesn't confirm their biases. Oftentimes these uneducated opinions can be changed when someone close for whom the person has deep respect comes out. It's also best to be between adults, as we are all sadly familiar with the horror stories of minors or very recent adults who come out to parents who doubt their child's knowledge or experience.

So again, thank you. I didn't see any comments here when I started this so I just wanted to express some support.

565;;11636;11636.0;Holofan4life;"**Time for the XPW invasion. Sorry it's so long.**

**First, here’s what Jerry Lynn said about the Heatwave 2000 incident.**

Jerry Lynn: They were trying to make a name for themselves off of us, but all that came out in the end was that they made fools of themselves, and they embarrassed themselves. There was no way they were going to get any good out of it.

**Next, here’s what Rob Black said shortly after this took place in an interview he did for a website.**

RB: Let me ask you something…

AL: OK?

RB: I’ve had experiences with other wrestling websites and every time they edit everything down for some reason. Is it going to be like that?

AL: You just let me know what you want on the record.

RB: I’ll tell you, whenever I talk, and this is from the business I’m in, whatever I say is 100% quotable. I never think ’Oh gee, I shouldn’t have said that’. I’m straight shooting at that’s what I’m about. Very obnoxious
and forward. Right to the point. Sometimes that pisses people off and sometimes it doesn’t. My basic feeling is I don’t give a f**k.

AL: Well, like I said. I tell everyone I interview that you can speak to me as Al and you can speak to me as Scoops. What you say to me as Al stays off the record between us. However you want it is cool with me.

RB: You got it.

AL: Let’s start at the beginning with your relationship with Paul Heyman.

RB: A small background right up to this whole… I don’t call it a fiasco because everything, aside from Paul and his crew beating up ring crew guys outside everything went according to plan.

AL: OK.

RB: It started way back. My brother who owns a couple of adult book stores sponsored a radio station that sponsored ECW coming out to Rochester, New York. My brother got to go hang out backstage or wherever the hell, and met Bubba and Dick (Dudley). They talked to them and Bubba was like ’la-di-da-di-da’ and my brother said ’hey my brother is Rob Black’ and they were like ’Oh my God’ and they wanted to meet me. Subsequently we were in New York two months later and I went up and I met Dick and we got along instantly and we all started hanging out. Prior to this I had dealings with Steve Carole in a roundabout way because Steve Carole, people don’t know, but Steve Carole is in the pornography business. They like to keep it on the down-low, but Steve Carole has put out money for porno, he was involved with Penthouse, one of his best friends sells cable rights for the adult industry and wanted to buy my stuff. They did a movie years ago with Jasmine St. Claire when she did her first lesbian movie. This with Jasmine’s manager. They wanted me to but the movie.

And I was like, this movie is a hunk of s**t! So that was the start of heat with Steve Carole. He so desperately wanted to be in the porno business, but evreything he did was just garbage. I was essentially everything Steve
Carole wanted to be. I was the big pornographer, I was the one who owned the biggest company in the business, I was the one who was the player in the porno business and he wanted to be the player. And I shunned his stupid f**king movie. And I wouldn’t sell my movies to his boy Bruder at his company CDA, or CDI, whatever it is. So I started hanging out with Bubba and them, and we started off talking about things. You know? How can we cross-promote? What can we do? ECW was f**king struggling and let’s see what we can do. So they started talking to Paul and said we want to get some of the girls on the Pay Per View. We got Jasmine on. I flew Jasmine out and she did the spot with Francine. No money,
didn’t ask for money, nothing. Bubba and Dick and Dreamer and Francine spent New Years Eve with me at my f**king house. Spent the night.

We went out to the Rainbow Room, you know? We spent New Year’s Eve together. I’ve got ’Whack Attack 5’ with Bubba, Dick, and Tommy Dreamer in the video! You know, Tommy’s shooting scenes and the camera goes over and there’s Bubba and Dick behind the scenes. We actually had to cut one thing out because Tommy was on the phone with Raven. We were like, ’who ya’ talking to Tommy?’ and he says, ’I’m talking to Raven, but make sure you cut that out because Paul will go nuts’. It was when Scott was over in WCW. So we had this big relationship going on! It was a cross-promotion. I went to ECW and they had us come out with Big Sal, Tommy and Lizzie. Paul was like, ’shoot the camera and shoot the footage and you can put it on your tape’ and xxxxx like that. I told him I’d run trailers for the ECW product, we move 80,000 ca$$ettes a month, we’ll put your trailers on them and we’ll do this thing. Then me and Paulie came up with advertising on his station.

AL: This was before TNN.

RB: Right. What we were going to do was we were going to come up with an internet company. And it’d show Jasmine St. Claire in the commercial and say, Do you want to see Jasmine St. Claire vacuuming the carpet?’ and it would show her vacuuming, ’Dial up www. Whatever it was going to be’. You’d click into it and you’d see Jasmine vacuuming. But as you go a couple of more clicks it says, ’To see explicit action and you’re 18, click here’. Paulie came up with this idea to put the pornography on the commercial to get the money. I mean we’re talking $20,000 a month to advertise and how we
could do it under the censors, under his local people so they would never give a xxxxx. They wouldn’t know. One weekend he spent the whole night with me. He came out, had a meeting, came to my office for 5 hours, went to dinner, and stayed at my house until 7 o’clock the next day. He stayed up and talked business and came up with this thing we were going to do. I have a company in Brazil. I was going to buy his masters and distribute his product in Brazil. We’re talking about
essentially coming up with a quarter of a million dollars to ECW at a time when they were piss broke! More than what they are now! More than bouncing checks to everybody. Remember, I hung out with Bubba and all them and they
would sit there and tell me, ’yeah, Paulie didn’t give me my money this week’, Bubba and them would warn me ’Dude, he’s going to f**k you, straight up he’s going to f**k you.’ And I just said, ’nah’, you know?

Well, while I had this relationship with ECW, my vice-president Kevin had this company called SECW, independent wrestling fed. I was going to do local wrestling thing out here and sell the tapes because I knew I could promote it and had the distribution. Henceforth, look at our first video. We’ve been on the chart for recreation sports for like the last ten f**king weeks. In order to do that you’ve got to move some numbers, regardless of what Meltzer and them say. ’Oh, all you’ve got to do is move 300 pieces in a week to get on there.’ He’s full of xxxxx! You know, if that’s the case then why the f**k ain’t WCW in there? You gonna’ tell me that a Hogan video doesn’t move 300 pieces in a f**king week? You know, Meltzer is a schmuck. He’s just a f**king schill just like that guy Dave Scherer. He’s a f**king schill for ECW, Meltzer, Bob Ryder. They’re all f**king schills. I never really realized how political this business was until I really got going.

Me and Kevin were going to do this thing and I said, ’no, I’m doing this thing with ECW’. Well all of a sudden two weeks later Paul is on the internet dissolving any relationship he ever had with me whatsoever. And what Bubba told me was he all of a sudden got in negotiations with TNN and some other people, and Steve Carole put a bug in his ear because Steve didn’t like me. He wanted him to go with this guy John Bowan who had that girl Kendra Jade that was on the Springer show. He told him that if he wanted anything to do with porno then this was the guy to do it with. And Paul E. just basically told me to go f**k myself. After I did all this xxxxx! You know! I’m flying people out there, I’m doing things for RF Video, we’re doing all this xxxxx for free!

AL: And publicly it just looks like he wants to have his hands clean when ECW goes to TNN.

RB: He wanted to have his hands clean, he didn’t want anybody in the negotiations to know. So one day Bubba calls me and he’s like, ’Rob, you’ve got to take us off that movie that you guys did.’ I’m like, ’what do you mean?’ and he says, ’you’ve got to do a recall on that’. Then I find out that basically Bubba was talking to the WWF and was nervous that Vince would find out and get upset. Henceforth, unfortunately Bubba was a pawn in the game. I told him I couldn’t recall the tapes. And then he says, ’well, you showed that footage at ECW Arena and Paulie never gave you permission’.

575;;9693;9693.0;toadfosky;"> Furthermore, 2011 NCAA Men’s Basketball Tournament played a significant role in Durant’s decision. The Warriors would draft Washington State guard Klay Thompson with the 11th pick. Despite only playing there for one season, Durant still has a strong bond with the city of Seattle, and more broadly speaking the state of Washington. However, with the emergence of the Seahawks, his popularity within the city and state began to wane, significantly impacting his ability to acquire marijuana once it became decriminalized. He was so desperate he even begged a few Broncos players for some cannabis at Super Bowl 50, but Peyton only offered him Budweiser and Papa John’s. Klay, through the connections he built during his three years at Washington State, promised Durant exclusive access to the best and most sought after marijuana if he were to join the Warriors.

If you're asking this then you clearly have no idea about our military or military history - for instance during Vietnam, most of our troops were on amphetamines... and in the 40's our troops were given LSD ...so by your logic they should all have disallowed from service?

This has nothing to do with politics. Nothing you've described has anything to do with politics.

But should they dare speak obvious truths, they get attacked by ad hominems from well-intentioned people who refuse to accept reality. If the goal of civilization is to make progress, the idea that Hillary Clinton is a better candidate than Bernie Sanders is pure fantasy.
There are plenty of smart, reasonable, and well-informed Hillary supporters -- But there are plenty smart, reasonable, well-informed Christians, Jews, and Muslims too. I think the explanations for why Hillary is a better candidate than Bernie are as unreasonable as religion. But good luck getting a follower to realise it.

622;;10563;10563.0;talto;"Well that's what the idea supposedly represents but you've got the outcomes and realities therein completely confused. 

In order to manifest communism you need to give the state ultimate power.  Power to tell people what to do with their belongings and lives.  This power must ultimately be given to someone and every time it corrupts, these angels you hope exist do not exist.  Anyone that actually had the morals you think they should have would never want that kind of coercive power over people in the first place.  We've seen it time and time again and whether you like it or not the end result is the same, the leader does not take the power and use it for good.  

You see someone like Bill Gates and you confuse them as having power.  They have some, but mostly what they have is influence.  He may be able to buy an island but he is not allowed to come into your home and take your things or violate your life or directly encroach on you.  But if you look at the leaders from the big communist movements (stalin, hitler, kim jong, pol pot, castro) this is exactly the kind of power they had and they abused it to the point of catastrophe.

So you are definitely confused.  What actually happens is the ""proletariat"" thinks that they are gaining power by binding together and submitting but all they are actually doing is surrendering any power they might have had to some political leader and it ends in misery every time.

So you'll find that not only are you wrong, you have completely spun the logic 180 degrees.  Liberty is the only system that has actually established a middle class and created large group of wealthy people outside of nobility or the state, effectively dispersing the power away from the rulers.  In a state run society the only people that live well off are the ruling class and those that enforce for them, everyone else is screwed and barely squeezes by with whatever the bare minimum is that the state will allow them. This is as consistent as gravity.

629;;12637;12637.0;;"First of all, **GET IN TOUCH WITH YOUR LOCAL DEPARTMENT OF HUMAN SERVICES!**

If you do one thing, do that, and explain your *whole* situation to whoever you can book a meeting with. They have helped **hundreds** of people in the same boat as you, and most of them are there because they love doing it.

And they are **good** at this getting these people out of trouble shit.

They know what local child care places have sliding fee scales/scholarships for people in need (hint: Boys and Girls Clubs and YMCAs are usually AWESOME about that), who you need to talk to to get your kids in Head Start/Early Head Start (another thing you DEFINITELY need to be looking into), what free lawyers work best at getting people out of family court drama, what local schools give free breakfasts and lunches for kids during the summers, and what other ways you can get help from people who want to give you help.

The Department of Human Services is literally the one-stop shop of Getting People Unfucked. You *need* to go there. Bad.

Second thing second, **farmers markets**. It's a small thing, but the way you get ahead in cutting costs is to use a lot of small things. Farmers markets are awesome because you get an INSANE amount of healthy food for a super-cheap price because there's no middle-man.

[Vegetable co-ops are AWESOME for this too.](http://www.coopdirectory.org/directory.htm) Buying directly from local farmers saves you an INSANE amount of money; you get to buy the stuff at basically wholesale, plus it tastes better and is better for you.

Also...as crazy as this sounds, consider going vegan. Beans, eggs, and legumes are cheap as fuck compared to meat.

Third, **that phone bill is fucking ridiculous.**

[You can get it down to $100 a month just by switching to T-Mobile.](http://www.t-mobile.com/cell-phone-plans/individual.html?icid=WMM_TM_WHYTMBL_VGYX4O6X41Y193)

*But what about my Early Termination...""*

[**T-Mobile PAYS your early termination fee AND gives you money towards a new phone when you trade your old one in.**](http://www.t-mobile.com/offer/switch-carriers-no-early-termination-fee.html)

Most people here would recommend a service like Ting or Republic, but in a situation like yours, but considering that the ETO goes away and that you'll get money for new phones, going the T-Mobile route makes WAY more sense.

Fourth, **don't cancel the internet.** [Comcast and other telcos offer $9 plans for people who need them.](http://everyoneon.org/)

The internet is the SINGLE most effective value-add you can have for yourself. From the internet, you can learn SO MANY marketable skills. Are the skills themselves going to make you an insane amount of money? No; but the knowledge available on the internet for free makes it possible to study for something like an A+ or Net+ computer certification, which can definitely open doors.

>""$1145""

That's fucking **BONKERS**. Your Department of Human Services worker should DEFINITELY be able to find you something cheaper, probably through the Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD).

>-owns 2 vehicles; a 2000 Chevy s10 (not running - engine problems +body damage) and a 98 saturn 2-door something that runs and is decent on gas, but we cannot get to pass inspection to get it registered to save our lives. -financed a Mazda 3 that got repoed with $6000 left.

...so what you're saying is that you don't have a car?

[This is a program that exists in my community.](http://www.goodwillnmi.org/jobs/car-donations/)

A similar thing might exist for people in your area. Your DHS person would know if this is the case. 

(Noticing a pattern?)

Quick anecdote: when I was young, my parents slept in the front room in our 1-bedroom house. When you're broke, anywhere that can fit a bed is a master bedroom. You don't *need* a 3 bedroom house.

**When it comes to the college thing, talk to the school about it.**

Are you able to go to school part-time to be able to work full-time? Do they have scholarships for people who are financially struggling? Some colleges even have things like free/low-cost child-care (often through the College of Education)/.

There are people at the college who are specifically there to help you, but they can't help you if they don't know what's going on.

The quicker you get that degree, the quicker you get out of this shit-hole. And you didn't pick a bad major (before reddit jumps my shit, she's going to make WAY MORE than $25-28k.). You need to keep working toward it, and you're almost there.

**Your husband needs to work more hours, even if it's for a lesser hourly wage**

Yeah, I know the health benefits. But, programs exist SPECIFICALLY to help people who are struggling with health insurance.

[Medicaid is the obvious one](https://www.healthcare.gov/how-can-i-save-money-on-marketplace-coverage/), but you may also be able to either A) qualify for a reduced cost Marketplace insurance plan or B)   
use the [CHIP program](https://www.healthcare.gov/are-my-children-eligible-for-chip/) to reduce the cost for your children's healthcare. 

Again, this is something to bring up to DHS. Worst case secnario, they can direct you with where to go.

***Lastly, you both need to change your mindset.***

>Plus, if we can help it we'd prefer not to be on them anyway.

Look, here in America, social services get a bad wrap. Your'e supposed to ""do it yourself"" and ""pick yourself up by your bootstraps"".

That's kinda hard to do when you can't even afford boots.

You deserve a fair shake.

Your husband deserves a fair shake.

Oh my god, your **KIDS** REALLY, REALLY, REALLY deserve a fair shake.

People want to see you become a badass athletic trainer (which, by the way, don't let these people on the internet trick you, is an AWESOME major, [look at dat job outlook](http://www.bls.gov/ooh/healthcare/athletic-trainers-and-exercise-physiologists.htm).)

People want to see your family living comfortably, and your husband having a good job, and your kids being happy and enjoying life.

That's why ""programs"" and ""the system"" exist, because people want you to be able to get out of this shit predicament and make something good with your life, and they know that **LIFE ISN'T FUCKING FAIR AT ALL**, but they don't want someone (like yourself) who can REALLY help people out at some point to fall through the cracks because life can be a dick.

In 10 years, when you help a patient regain strength in their legs, do you think that she's going to be upset that you were ""in the system""? In 8 years, when you help a patient regain motion in his arms, do you think he's going to get mad because you ""stole his tax dollars""?

Nah, they're both going to look at you like you're some sort of fucking miracle worker.

And that's why these programs exist.

These are all the children that they are going to get, and thus each child is very precious.

It was no surprise that in an act of good will meant to forestall rebellion and improve the population size and health of their new vassal involved several hundred midwives and childbirth experts going down. They learned how to cocoon young, how to ease egg laying, and how to tend to a mothers' young. Exuding a pleasant aura and humming comforting tunes, they can often be found in medical complexes and in individual houses, consulting with expectant mothers and providing care and comfort.

First off - your cell phone. If it is ""required"" for your job, please see if your boss will give you a flat fee per month toward your phone (most places will call it a stipend). AT least $30/month to pay for the data services they're requiring you to have. At this point, any little bit is going to help. If they refuse, you refuse to use your personal device for work, and drop the smartphone. Your credit can take all of the hits right now; you need to focus on keeping yourself, your husband and your kids under a roof. Pay $10 a month toward the cancellation fee. Your credit will be shit, but you'll at least be able to feed yourself. 

Eat rice and beans. Buy them in bulk. 

Unplug every single electronic in the house when you're not using it. Phone chargers, TV's, computers... anything. They can still leech power even if it's off or not being used, and sometimes you'd be really surprised how much you'll save in doing this. Teach the kids to all mind their electricity usage and only turn on lights when absolutely necessary. I know when I was a kid, I turned on every light all the time and never turned them off. As an adult who now pays for electricity, I turn them off immediately. 

You're going to have to quit school for awhile and pick up some work. 2 part time jobs might be more flexible than 1 full time job. 

Is there any chance you guys are able to move to a different city? It sounds like you're having a really hard time where you are.. have you checked to see what job opportunities are in other areas? Sometimes they'll even pay some of your moving costs if they want your experience. 

Can you work full time nights while your husband does days, or vice versa? That way you get someone home at all times and dual incomes. 

Please keep your head up and look for any and all opportunities. Do it for the kids, your husband, and yourself. It's only harder when you're down on yourself. Think of this as your life's greatest challenge and look at the end result that YOU want. Don't let that vision fade.

You said women. Why are you OK with women? They're physically less capable or is physical capability not an issue in combat?

> Do you have any idea the toll war takes on normal, healthy well adjusted individuals? Of course you don't, because you've never served. If you did, you'd know exactly why this is the right decision.

Hey Oh...look at that assumption. It doesn't matter if I say I served or didn't serve. Talk to Kristin Beck. That's a 20 year Navy SEAL. Tell Kristin that she isn't fit or mentally competent to serve. Not because I want to see you beat up, destroyed, etc - but because this is someone who is living proof that what you're saying is false. It's evidence.

There is an entire veterans group of trans-gendered individuals made up of people who served and completed their service honorably. Tell them that they're not as mentally fit. Tell them how dangerous they'd be with a gun or how unable they would be to complete missions.

You don't have to serve to understand that thousands of transgender veterans who have completed their services HONORABLY are evidence to the contrary of your concerns.

A study published by the Journal of Racial and Ethnic Health Disparities showed white males were more likely to suffer from depression, despite reporting less stress, than black men. In short: white men are more likely to be depressed despite feeling less stress than black men.

So for the sake of our brothers in arms, should us white men be removed from service? It's likely we would be mentally unable to cope with the horrors of war - certainly moreso than black men.

Wtf?  Humans are complex beings.  It's never A or B.  Just because Psychology 101 was easy for you does not make the study of psychology an easy science.

> Science is not immune to agendas

Science and research is evolving.  The beauty of science is that it's never at 100%.   What someone said 30 years ago may or may not apply to today.  Conservatives like to point out Dr. McHughs statements about mental illness and transgenderism because he's a doctor with credentials and was from John Hopkins.  John Hopkins disavowed his statements and as I stated earlier, the WHO has made it clear that transgenderism is moving away from being classified as a mental disorder.

There are so much to digest with this post rather than the first one. The first one was more into statistic and accountable value, while this one veers closer into societal and popular resonance, which therefore needs more cautious reading to avoid preferential bias.

One thing that is clear is that Jokowi run a more streamlined and well-thought campaign. One factor of course due to how powerful his campaign team is, but the other I think is because there's not much that you can do if your only selling point is Islamism. It is as constraining as it is powerful.

Meanwhile Jokowi successfully married his powerful Javanese base with the disenfranchised (Non moslem and Non Javanese/Malayan moslem). Him courting the Islamist through Ma'ruf Amin alienate some of his secular voter base, but the choice proposed within Prabowo and his HTI backers left them to choose between bad and absolute worst.

Maybe Prabowo would fare better if he did not limit himself with the religion vehicle, Idk.

But reading your post gave me a sense of hope, I thought Jokowi's victory in Central and Eastern Java was won mostly due to the political sacrifices he had to make with Ma'ruf Amin and his NU backers. It looks like they're leaning heavily towards him, NU or otherwise, anyway.

Hopefully it is so, and the Javanese voter base would not be troublesome if he doesn't yield easily to NU's demand.

The only real point of contention I want to raise with regards to operational cost of conditional and direct cash transfers. I don't think you mentioned it, but overhauling to an NIT program is assumed to be lower cost because you can basically just build it into the current tax system and have the IRS manage it. Where as currently there's +100 different programs, each with their own administrative costs.

With regards to conditional cash transfers, it's quite often the case that the benefit gets passed on to people whom it wasn't intended. For example, there is a large market for food stamps, and in selling them, people are left with consumption at lower levels than they would have given a direct cash transfer.

These could just be a red herring and that the current structure of welfare programs needs to be better optimized, but it's food for thought.

942;;12121;12121.0;sonyaellenmann;"Based on my own experiences with the underclass in California (I'm being a little vague to protect family members' privacy) I think Vance's depiction of the constant self-defeating dysfunction is accurate.

Totally different part of the country, different ethnic makeup(s), and yet the same ultimate culture. Girls get knocked up early and stay with terrible men, everyone is in and out of jail, everyone is on drugs, everyone gets fat, and everyone is emotionally abusive to everyone else around them. The few people with steady jobs often subsidize their deadbeat family members.

I do think Vance understates the important of cognitive factors. If you're not born smart or motivated, or if you don't luck into substantive support from functional people with ties to functional institutions, then you're fucked. You're never getting out of this miserable culture and you probably don't even understand why. Easy to self-medicate into a fog — hey, alcohol works too!

Maybe you're not just dumb and depressed, but you also have undiagnosed and untreated ADHD. So of course you dropped out of high school. And later, lucky you, time to injure yourself at your intermittent shitty job, leading to chronic pain, so the self-medication steps up, etc.

I'm generalizing, yes, and focusing on the negative aspects. Lots of underclass people are sweet, funny, and loving. But the destructive impulsiveness seems pervasive, and hardly anyone is equipped to properly care for the kids they keep having, so it's a rapidly self-replicating cycle.

The yelling thing was viscerally striking to me. I come from the genteel WASP-y middle class, and even hearing my parents snap at each other was pretty rare. Mom only yelled at us occasionally, when we were particularly defiant.

Interacting with the underclass, I can literally feel my stress levels rising, whereas they seem to take the incessant screaming and bickering in stride. I dunno if they've just adjusted to the emotional toll or if they really don't respond to combative conversations in the same way that I do.

1020;;12619;12619.0;eleigh5;"When I or anyone else in my area complains about people living on welfare, it's true. There are plenty of career subsidy-recipients out there that are not honest. I'm not necessarily talking about TANF or W2 as it's called in Wisconsin. I'm talking about WIC and food stamps and energy assistance and obama phones and Medicaid and renters assistance and child care subsidys and social security (for questionable but seemingly legal reasons) and the list goes on and on and on. 

Yes, it's true that you can only buy food with SNAP, but it is also true that many people sell their benefits to others for cash. To use the card, all you need is the pin. I personally have had many people offer to sell me $100 worth of groceries for $50. 

With renter's assistance, here the mad you pay for rent is $75/mo for a nice 2 bedroom place. $75 per month!

With childcare subsidy, in my area, families get up to $162.50 per child per week for child care costs. They are working, but most work as little as possible so they can keep their benefits. I personally know people who have it calculated how much they can make before their benefits decrease. 

And when I say social security, I don't mean the people who actually need it. I'm speaking of the law that if your child is a speci needs child and has an IEP, you qualify for SS. These special needs can range from severe (which I'm totally for giving benefits to parents who have a full time job taking care of special needs children) to mild, like mild behavior problems, mild cognitive problems... The parents of these children are not financially distressed because of their child's disability. And most parents who qualify don't take advantage of this part of the system. It's parents who make it a full time job to live off handouts who know about these loop holes. 

And yes, you can live off the system. It's true you can only be on our W2 system for 2 years, however you can be on renters assistance and energy assistance and food stamps and what ever else for extended periods of time. 

Yeah, if I could work 12 hours a week at a part time job and sit home and smoke weed for the rest of the time while paying almost nothing out of pocket to live, I'd do it too.

1025;;12055;12055.0;ubasta;"> First off, he says the aim of this is to help people that lose their jobs to automation… but then he also states that UBI is only supposed to be supplementary income and will encourage people to find jobs… that are getting eliminated due to automation? How does that work? It’s a logical conundrum.

1000/month is enough to provide people to live, it's a guarantee that even though you will be out of job, at least you have something to eat and somewhere to live. meanwhile it gives them some time to reconsider their future path, maybe learn a new trade. it provides a cushion for them to transition through this tough time. when automation hits and people lost their jobs without any cushion, there will be violence. people are already violently protesting against self driving cars and trucks.

>He proposes to fund his plan with a Value Added Tax. A value added tax is NOT progressive taxation, but rather a highly REGRESSIVE one. Essentially, it increases the base costs of goods and services, by Yang’s proposal a 10% increase across the board—a Flat Tax. This disproportionally affects the poor who already have less money to go around to pay for goods and services. 

it's not a regressive tax because basic goods are tax exempted, such as grocery, tuition, medical costs, public transportation. you have outdated information, so i would recommend watching more of his recent interviews. essentially he's proposing a luxury VAT that taxes on people who have disposable incomes.

>Yang does correctly state that his proposal—if fully funded—would not lead to inflation as critics might say—if you are talking about de-valuing of currency increasing prices. However, that’s only one form of ‘inflation,’ the other being rising prices on the supply end, which this WOULD affect greatly. He then goes on to say some patently ridiculous supply-side economics bullshit:

you have to back your statements with facts, you can't be telling people how you feel. this is a free market, the prices fluctuates based on supply and demand. since we are so good with automation and production, the costs will not go up because they can continue to produce more goods at faster rate. in most cases, the prices are determined by competition and costs of goods. since neither of those are changing much, the costs will not go up by that much. for housing, 1000/month will give people the freedom to buy houses or move to cheaper cost of living communities. especially for a family of 2, they can get 2000/month, that means you can buy a 400k house without a problem.

>And claiming that technology will decrease the prices of things? Facepalm. This completely assumes that corporations would pass their production savings onto consumers which is the exact opposite of what happens: in reality they ALWAYS pocket the reduced costs as profits, never lowering their prices at all.

why did you think inflation rate has been so low for the past few decades? it's because companies have been competing on lower prices and they do that by offshoring jobs and increasing automation in their production lines https://www.thebalance.com/u-s-inflation-rate-history-by-year-and-forecast-3306093";1801;1.0;Yang's UBI plan is horribly flawed;https://www.reddit.com/r/WayOfTheBern/comments/beqrz9/yangs_ubi_plan_is_horribly_flawed/;1

Back in the good old days, which would be around 5000 B.C. (Earth Time), 5 tribes emerged from some unkown source of life.

The Blue:

Sargonians that evolved with fins and lived in the ocean. They could breathe underwater and had a home base in Denite Bay. Forever friends with The Black, they rarely went onto Fafrun  and into the sun. They shied away from human contact and didn't live with the other tribes in the unification of the tribes. Died out in 2238 (Earth Time) from desertification.

-

The Black:

Blind, peaceful, and very wise. These are words that describe The Black. Only one tribe of Black ever existed, and they are the oldest known race. Born in the caves underneath Fafrun, they originated from some unkown source in the Earth year 5676 B.C.

They never went above ground but did agree to the unification of the tribes.

They all died when the Underground Caves collapsed in 2003.

-

The Green:

These Sargonians evolved around 2000 B.C. from a mutant color Orange Sargonian. He escaped Sargon and ran into the grassy hills of Southern Fafrun. The grass here reached up to 30 feet tall, allowing for some shade. Prehistoric monsters and unknowns lived here, and so did the mutant. He eventually found a girl wandering around there, lost, and they mated. Their descendants are known as The Green. They are the third largest race, and moved back into Sargon after Kibon took power in 1275 (Earth Year).

The Orange:

The main race of Sargonians, these developed from the few Blue who
wandered on top of the island Fafrun. They spent one thousand of years in the desert caves, before some of the tribes split off and created Sargon. Here they used tools to build houses and many walls. The main tribe and the multitude of others fought for a long time before Jesus arrived in 3113 B.C. and unified the tribes under the sword, Rajoxle.";1886;1.0;Insane Lore: SARGON;https://www.reddit.com/r/worldbuilding/comments/6rul0i/insane_lore_sargon/;0

Firstly Clinton wasn't a great candidate. Sanders would have trounced Trump. The trade deal issue was probably the deciding factor for a lot of people.

Secondly, the people in the rust belt were willing to overlook all of the disgusting things Trump said because he made them feel warm and fuzzy by appealing to past greatness, and promised to restore American industry.

They actually think that a guy who is a billionaire that has made a living screwing the middle class his entire life is going to now fight for the middle class.

They should be able to help you assess your entire situation and make appropriate referrals to services in your area that can help you. What you really need is a good social worker. Hopefully, someone from your school can refer you to an agency that can help you.

You should also speak with your academic advisor about leaving school and what it will do to your ability to return when you are more financially stable. You might also want to stop by the financial aid office to see if they have any funds available for students who are facing emergencies. You also need to talk to them about repayment options. When the time comes, you might qualify for deferment or forbearance. [This website](https://studentloans.gov/myDirectLoan/index.action) has just about all the information you need to know about student loans but it often helps to have someone to explain it to you.

I do strongly suggest you check out legal aid services for you to get the ordered child support for your child. In my state, the Attorney General's Office will often pursue child support on behalf of parents who are not receiving it. Having support for your own child will help your overall situation.

You are in a difficult situation. I wish you the best of luck.

1184;;12689;12689.0;GoldenBough;"I didn't make it all the way through the wall'o'text, but there are a few points I'd like to lay out.

> Bureaucracy

""Universal"" eliminates the need for administration, as you don't have to keep ""means testing"" people like you do with a welfare system.  Means testing is both expensive, as you have to hire people to perform the testing, and denigrating because people who need the benefits have to go somewhere (taking valuable time that could be spent working or with their family; and often people who need it are the ones who can least afford to take the time, which often includes public transportation with kids in tow) and then abase themselves in some manner to show that they really are hard off and need a handout.  This is *toxic* for children; growing up on welfare is a stigma that persists for years and has a real impact on a persons perception of themselves.

> Welfare trap and system gaming

When there is a means testing system, you will incur one or both of these.  If you can work under the table and keep collecting your benefits, there is a powerful incentive to keep doing that.  Or, if you are in a position were working a job doesn't get you much farther ahead than just collecting your benefits, you've also incentivized that behavior.  UBI is intended to make every dollar you earn get you a dollar ahead, instead of some fraction of that as your benefits trickle away.

> Rational actors

This part is complete bunk.  It operates from the assumption that poor people are poor because of their own bad decisions with money.  That poor people don't know what's good for them, and need someone wiser to babysit their spending.  Which is a position with no real support.  If someone needs money to fix their car so they can get a better job farther away, more SNAP money isn't going to help.  People are surprisingly rational when they are in a *position* to be rational.

1212;;13243;13243.0;Warbotter;"234. Sherri Martel showed up one day during the interview segments and stood in a postion where only Nelson and Zybsko could see her in the studio. She then proceded to hike up her dress giving them a shot of the full moon then left in a hurry. 

235. Donovan Morgan did a shoot with a couple of friends of mine and told a short story of how he left APW to become the head trainer at XPW. On his first day he went to lunch and when he came back to the office they wouldn't let him in the door. He peeked in and saw a nice girl sitting at his desk blowing about 6 guys. He quit shortly after. There are a lot of XPW sleaze stories, the sad part are the ones that stuck around though the sleaze. 

236. Big T/Ahmed Johnson/Tony Norris supposedly bragged about how when he was pimping underage girls, that he had them sooo pimped that he used their tongues for TP. 

237. There was an indy guy up here known as Michael Stryker (I believe he was originally Matt Stryker, but then changed his name because of the Heartland Matt Stryker). He was a nice guy, really short cruiser, and apparently he had a habit of pretending everything he could get his hands on was his dick. So they're backstage, pissing around, and Stryker is there with his girlfriend. The Highlander uses a big axe for his gimmick, so Stryker picks up the axe, dangles it from his groin, pretending it's his junk. The axe falls, and chops his girlfriend's toe off. I heard he ended up marrying that same girl, and she's the one who convinced him to get out of the business. I guess you can only have your toe chopped off once before you decide whether wrestling is really what you want to dedicate your life to or not. 

238. Jake Roberts was working an NWA Southwest show against (I think) Kevin Northcutt (we'll say it's Northcutt). While he has Northcutt in a chinlock, Jake then proceeds to stick his index finger up the poor guy's ass. Jake later hits the DDT and Northcutt, upsert that he was the victim of Jake's sick sexual antics, kicks out of the pin and says ""That's for putting your finger up my ass!"" Jake, just having all his heat killed off, decides to finish the match by walloping Northcutt with his leather boot. 

239. It was well circulated in the sheets back then that when Dutch Mantel was doing the Uncle Zebekiah gimmick, at the motel one night he and Eli Blu got really fucked up on No-Doz and wood alcohol and they shaved off a bunch of Dutch's back hair, glued it to his crotch, and Eli ""ate him out."" 

240. A Music City wrestler and some friends were at Bert Prentice's home talking about wrestling. Bert's dog was sitting on the floor. In the middle of the conversation Bert slips off his shoe, and starts messaging his dogs nutsack with his big fat stinky toes. 

241. This might be the R. Kelley ECW story in more detail, I don't know. . . .. But in the mid 90s all the ECW boys stayed at the scummy Travelodge in Philly after the shows. There were a lot of rats, but there was this one Asian slut who was such a whore that even the boys were embarrassed for her, and some actually thought she was a pest. I actually saw her undo her top a button when the boys would get to the hotel and walk by her to the elevator. One night Stevie Richards and some of the boys took her up to a room and violated her in the ass with a coke bottle, then threw her out of the room naked. 

242. This guy was driving Kevin Von Erich to a show. Kevin asks him to pull over at a store, and hands the driver money and asks him to buy a six-pack of beer. The guy buys the beer, gives it to Kevin, and they hit the road again. 10 MINUTES LATER Kevin asks him top pull over at another store, hands him money, and asks him to buy beer because he just drank the last one. There's another version of this story in my mind with Kerry in the car, a case, and 10 minute intervals too . . . 

243. This was reported in the Observer:: a Cleveland promoter paid his boys in food stamps. 

244. On his shoot tape, Dennis Coraluzzo says that Derrick Domino got shit canned because he was caught stealing money from the boys bags for drug money. Dennis also tells a great story about how he was on the road with his fat right hand man Gino Moore, and Moore had some chocolate chip cookies with him. Gino fell asleep (as we have learned in this thread, that is not a good thing to do). Dennis proceeded to stick the cookies in between his bare butt cheeks, and put them back in the box . . and Gino woke up and start eating them. 

245. I remember this one timekeeper during a match with Scott Putski and Missy Hyatt telling me Scott had absolutely no clue or what planet he was on during the entire match. 
246. Ah one more. More of a sad sap story than a scum story, but what the hell. This is also from the Dennis tape, and I also heard it before I saw the tape.. This concerns the King of All Marks, this POS from Pennsylvania named Royce Prophet, real name Tom Cusadi. Tom blew his Moms inheritance on wrestling. He was the ultimate money mark. He would promote shows just so he could manage on them. One time he paid to have The Nasty Boys and some other workers flown to the Bahamas for a shot. When they got there, they discovered there was no show; Tom just wanted to hang out with wrestlers.

247. Tim Horner bought some frozen chimichangas and at the checkout line the cashier (chick) is like, ""oo, nice, have you had these before?"". It seemed she was talking to him in a flirtatious way about the chimichangas. Well, anyway, nothing really materialized there, but he ate one of the chimichangas and was ripping ass all night. All he could think of all night was ""do you think she's into getting farted on, and dutch ovens and that kind of thing?"" So he ends up going back to the shop the next day and getting more chimichangas, and she's all excited, and he gets the hook up and they go out later that week. Turns out they went to her place and she tied him up, and tried to take a shit on him! 

248. Jaime Dundee is a sick puppy. Guys have known that for quite some time. Unfortunately, he took it to a whole new level a few years back. Apparently, after a drinking, pot and coke binge with his cousin, he fucked her. And I don't just mean missionary. They did it all. I'm still in shock. The worst part is that he defended it by saying that she's really hot. Not sure if it's worse that he did it or that he was bragging about it. 

249. When the ring broke at Hardcore Heaven 1996 Kimona was asked to do a striptease by Paul E while the ring was fixed. Only problem was that Heyman promised her that it wouldn't be taped, but it was of course, and was later put on an ECW commercial video. 

250. Yes, its true: Shawn Michaels was a man-slut. But he shared the wealth, if you know what I mean. 

251. Man Mountain Rock was not the most popular person after people realized that he taped a lot of their most intimate backstage moments. Before he was fired, several of the wrestlers, including a certain ""trucker"" and a certain Portuguese Man Of War took a cumulative shit in a plastic bag and left it in his gym bag.. 

252. Nobody treated Nikolai Volkoff with any respect during his run as Ted DiBiase's lackey. Brian ""Crush"" Adams would constantly degrade him verbally, and Bryan ""Adam Bomb"" Clarke would often hold Volkoff down and give him noogies and pink bellies. Everytime I saw this, I'd just shake my head and keep on walking. 

253. The character of TL Hopper was created because of Pat Patterson's secret plunger fetish. Don't ask. 

254. Before Jeannie came to WCW as Steve Austins valet, his original WCW valet was called Vivacious Veronica. The only reason she was a valet is because she was fucking a Turner executive an he was bankrolling her coke habit..she threatened to tell his wife about their affair unless he made her a TV star, so he put her on WCW TV. She was so fucked up that she didnt last long. 

255. Buzz Sawyer got into a fight outside a club. The other guy pulls out a gun and sticks it in Buzz's mouth saying hes going to blow his head off. Buzz just stands their laughing with the loaded gun in his mouth and the other guy freaks out and leaves. 

256. ECW in 1999, they ran a show in Buffalo, NY. Mikey Whipwreck had invited his brother and some of his brother's friends to the show. Judge Jeff Jones gave GhB to Mikey Whipwreck's brother, who subsequently gave it to one of his friends, who then OD'd and died. Jones was subsequently fired from the company. For all those wondering why Jones disappeared all of a sudden, there's your answer. 

257. A friend of mine wrestles Indy shows in the Missouri, Kansas, Oklahoma area. One show that he worked involved that big muscular guy Jonah from MTV Tough Enough (I think it was the second one). I for one had no idea that the Tough Enough kids were taking indy bookings, but anway.. While Jonah was in the area, he stayed with my friend. I guess all sorts of crazy drunken things took place, as Jonah used his mighty MTV celebrity status to get free drinks and cheap drugs for everyone. One night after clubbing it up, Jonah got one of my friend's geeky smart-mark buddies involved in some kind of orgy with underaged girls in the back seat of a camaro. It may or may not have been this guys first time. So hang out with Jonah if you can, nerds. MTV psuedo-celebrities will getcha the midwest poontang. 

258. Madusa was a big time WWF ringrat when she was working as women's champ for the company. There's rumors about her and HBK, Bret Hart, and Kevin Nash. There's even an old issue of WWF magazine with an interview with Luna Vachon in it, and within her tirade of insults towards the then-Alundra Blayze she even refers to her as a ring rat.

And like a lot of people have said, portion control. You can eat whatever you like and lose weight as long as you watch calories.

If you can, try asking your local grocery for the peppers they're about to toss out.  I buy 3 for .50, cut off the gross pieces, chop up the rest and freeze them. They're great for cooking! I imagine you can request other fruits and vegetables that go ""bad"" as well. Bananas, for another example, are like .25/lb after they've gone brown. Freeze 'em if you're not using them right now.

1320;;1027;1027.0;;">Chromosomes are what decide your gender. You are male or female, and you do not get a say in it.

You seriously need to learn the difference between science and social construct. Chromosomes and DNA is science.  The gender assigned to the chromosomes is socially constructed. It's not hard to understand if you really want to or have the ability to.

>Yeah, a label for someone who is either both or neither. A hermaphrodite is literally both genders, or neither. The fact that they exist, despite the exponentially small population that exist, means they have to be called something.

Yeah that wasn't the point was it. And you're kinda proving my point. Scientifically, hermaphrodites have mixed chromosomes... therefore the fact that you HAVE to call them something because they don't fit into your construct of gender proves that gender is socially constructed and different from science. I mean, can you see how you're contradicting yourself especially since you tried to dismiss them from the conversation.

>They aren't. there are no trans people in combat positions.

Really? You say this with such certainty like you know all the trans people serving in the army before this ban. Why don't you read about this transgered person who served and was in a combat position AND was a captain:

https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/posteverything/wp/2017/07/26/i-served-34-years-in-the-army-im-transgender-president-trump-is-wrong/?utm_term=.a4c444a66102

Just because you believe something doesn't mean it's true. Your opinions aren't facts.

It's a bit rich accusing me of arguing with emotion and feelings when you're the one completely devoid of facts and logic and basing your argument on your opinion and prejudices. I'm talking about science. You're talking about what you think science is and applying it to your feelings. When you have personal prejudices against how someone leads their life then you're the one the engaging in emotions. 

If you want to talk about facts and logic then I suggest you go educate yourself on science and trans issues.

[They bring up a forty year conspiracy theory about US involvement in John Kerr dismissal of Gough Whitlam](https://www.theaustralian.com.au/nation/inquirer/john-kerr-put-whitlam-dismissal-conspiracy-theories-at-rest/news-story/431f51f8e618317526d862636d934c81), She then brings out old arguments that that **Australia isn't part of Asia and doesn't understand China.**  People in [Canberra panic, and they bring out the China Hand who most likely has been bought by China](https://www.bloomberg.com/opinion/articles/2019-09-16/-china-hands-got-china-wrong-but-listen-to-them-now).

Like [Bilahari Kausikan](https://www.straitstimes.com/singapore/sporeans-should-be-aware-of-chinas-influence-ops-bilahari) said she pushes her simplified narrative and false dilemma

* Australia faces[""100 years of solitude"" if it isolates itself  from its Asian neighbours by strengthening military ties with the United   States, a Chinese academic has warned in The Global Times](http://archive.is/Qd0tT#selection-1333.3-1337.1).

And says that Australia could benefit if she work for her own ""interest"" to mediate between China and the US.  This follows through with what  [Bilahari Kausikan](https://www.straitstimes.com/singapore/sporeans-should-be-aware-of-chinas-influence-ops-bilahari)  ""China doesn't just want you to comply with its wishes, it wants you to... do what it wants without being told.""

* [Australia's job is to not make trouble between each other or take sides, but to be very sensitive about this issue](https://www.abc.net.au/news/2019-09-25/china-academic-responds-to-scott-morrison-trade-comments/11546900)

China goes on these offensive that last can last months or even years, when smaller countries displease her. In recent years, [Japan](https://www.japantimes.co.jp/opinion/2019/02/05/commentary/japan-commentary/will-japan-china-reset-continue/#.XY6NsChKjcs), [South Korea](https://www.scmp.com/week-asia/politics/article/2114232/beyond-thaad-real-reason-why-china-angry-south-korea) and [Singapore](https://www.scmp.com/news/china/diplomacy-defence/article/2074648/china-singapore-sign-raft-agreements-amid-thaw) have displeased them. In the case of Japan, relations with China, alternate between freezes and warming.

If the society is as paranoia and racist as Australia as the Chinese media thinks, why is China racing to influence every Chinese community organization in Australia, donating millions to Australian politicians and political parties through its proxies. If You known you are putting your head in the hornet's nest why do it?

Among three countries  Australia, Canada and New Zealand, Australia is the most paranoid.

First Canada and New Zealand are smaller Anglo Saxon societies neighboring larger ones, US and Australia. They know if an external actor attacks, the bigger country will come to their aid. Being the only two ""white"" country in Asia, Australians fear is being swamped by the brown peril (Indonesia) or yellow peril (China), or the nightmare of some Australians, is both China and Indonesia forming an ""alliance"".

Secondly, A[ustralia racism originates from her dealings with aboriginals in contrast with New Zealand's interaction with the Maor](https://www.telegraphindia.com/opinion/why-australians-are-more-racist-than-new-zealanders/cid/1687439)i.

Thirdly, Chinese Australians have lower and more fleeting political representation compared Chinese Canadians  Prior to 1945 the vast majority of Chinese in Canada and Australia. Both countries were part of the British Empire, [the only Chinese who could vote were those who managed to become British subjects](https://www.library.ubc.ca/chineseinbc/naturalization.html)

>Only on rare occasions could naturalization laws be appealed by a judge if he or she decided that the petitioner would make a good citizen. Although some well-established, successful Chinese businessmen did become naturalized British subjects, the majority of Chinese could not.

In Canada, Chinese and Indians (Punjabi) gained naturalization and the vote in 1947., Australia allowed non-Europeans to become citizens in 1957 with 15 years residence. The first Chinese Canadian was elected to office was 1957, when [Douglas Jung](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Douglas_Jung) was elected to House of Commons, the first Chinese Australian to hold an elected position was [Helen Sham-Ho](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Helen_Sham-Ho) when she was elected NSW State Legislature in 1988.

This is the area where controlling the narrative is most importance over. It comes in four formshe was a bad representative. If I was Australian I would be less concerned about Gladys Liu's association with Chinese community organizations with suspected links to the CPC, but [her failure to  declare campaign donations](https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2019/sep/13/gladys-liu-accused-of-failing-to-declare-a-40000-donation-to-liberal-party), [her bigoted statements](https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2019/apr/29/liberal-candidate-gladys-liu-criticised-work-ethic-of-non-chinese-migrants). use of [misleading campaign signs](https://www.sbs.com.au/news/josh-frydenberg-gladys-liu-reportedly-admit-chinese-corflutes-instructed-correct-way-to-vote) and her abysmal defense of her questionable record. The reality with Gladys Liu is she is the first ""full blooded"" Chinese to be elected into the House of Representative, the three previous MP were [Ian Goodenough](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ian_Goodenough), [Gai Brodtmann](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gai_Brodtmann) and [Michael Johnson](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Michael_Johnson_(Australian_politician)), all of them were Eurasians.  Of course none of her activities are illegal, but make for bad optics, particularly for a lowly backbencher. Australia's experience with ethnic Chinese politicians is shallower than Canada's, and a rotten candidate doesn't do any good for either Australia, Chinese Australia and even China.

___________________________ 

On August 10, 2010, the USS John S. McCain, a guided-missile destroyer, docked in Da Nang harbor, in Vietnam, to commemorate the 15th anniversary of the normalization of relations between Washington and Hanoi. It was a momentous and emotional moment, in which the Vietnamese military command welcomed an American warship named after the father and grandfather of my fellow senator John McCain—a former naval aviator who had been held prisoner in the country for more than five years. The Vietnam War killed some 60,000 Americans and between 1.5 million and three million Vietnamese. Yet now Hanoi wanted an even deeper military and economic partnership with its former adversary, because it knew that this was the best way to improve its citizens’ security and quality of life.

Today—in the aftermath of one of the most bitter elections in recent U.S. history—is a good time for Americans to remember that story and remind themselves just how much influence the United States still possesses around the world. The key question the country now faces is what to do with it. It can continue along a reactive path and even reduce its commitments to its allies and the international institutions it helped create. Or it can start articulating a broad new strategy for reengaging with the world as its leading democracy. Americans should recognize their country’s unique strengths without indulging in either paranoia or unnecessary self-congratulation. That is what Truman and the U.S. Congress did 70 years ago, at a moment when bipartisan cooperation seemed unlikely.

1509;;9636;9636.0;bleedingjim;"I went to bed early last night so I could get up at 5AM and to the polls by 6AM. Before heading to bed, I put together my ""Primary Kit"" which included: 

2 back-up battery packs (fully charged) 1 connector cable kindle extra headphones Survival Guide 3 months of ""My Voter Detail"" PDF extracts (as proof of active status) Drivers License (which I always have on hand)

I set my cell to charge, and headed off to sleep. Around 2AM, I had a reflux attack (because of course I would), and when the alarm went off at 5AM, I was sore tempted to keep hitting the snooze button. But then News 12 reported Clinton was ahead by 700 delegates and all desire for sleep evaporated (nothing irritates me more than inaccuracy in reporting and News 12 has woken me from a dead sleep many times from their ineptitude). With bleary eyes, I furiously harangued News 12 on Twitter about their perpetual inaccuracy, then got up to get ready to vote.

I ended up wearing my purple striped long-tee because I figured there was no way in hell anyone would derive ""campaigning"" from a purple shirt with lavender stripes (and I was taking 0 chances of having my vote denied). If it had been a tad warmer, I was sorely tempted to wear my Dr Strange tee, just because I plan on stretching my mid-life crisis out another decade or so. ;-) )

I had expected to walk to the polls (about a 5 minute walk) but my husband offered to drive (which is nice because I get vertigo these days, and there have been a rash of pedestrian hit-and-runs in my area). We left around 7AM, and I remarked to my husband ""I am late to the Revolution!""

We made it to the polling center entrance which was blissfully uncontaminated by campaign effluvia. 

As I entered the polling location, I decided I wasn't going to take pictures of the poor folks. They were all older folks and almost look startled, like timid forest animals when a hiker stumbles unexpectedly into a glade. I don't think they expected that someone would be in this early. They were prepared and ready to go, however. 

I was the only voter there.

I went to the center table, and the lady asked for my card. Of course, the ONE thing I forgot. However, she quickly deduced what my perplexed stare meant and said ""no worries, what is your address?"" I told her and she pointed me to the table I was supposed to be at. 

At my table, there was a little old man and a slightly nervous Hispanic woman, maybe a few years older than me. They first asked me my name, and as the little old man was looking me up, the slightly nervous Hispanic woman started putting my election kit together. The little old man stopped her. Firmly he told her ""No. We have to do this in the right order. This has to be done properly."" I fell in love with the little old man, right there and then. 

Once I was properly signed in, the little old man asked if I had ever used the new scanner before (while the slightly nervous Hispanic woman went back to preparing my ballot package). I figured I would let them give me the tour, so I said ""no."" The little old man took my ballot and explained the process, noting quickly that I was ""Ballot Number 1."" He started to explain how to fill the ballot in, and noted ""see, here's Bernie Sanders and..."" then he got distracted by something the slightly nervous Hispanic lady was doing before returning to our discussion, where he started over: ""So there's ... Sanders and ..."" and his hand drifted to the second line which had Clinton's name. ""...and you use the special pen to mark in the ovals. Don't go past the lines."" Now, while I do not believe the little old man was trying to convey anything, I thought it adorable that he kept going back to Sanders. I also got a kick over Bernie being listed first on my ballot.

I took the ballot to the special desk where you fill in your choices behind a privacy screen. I selected Bernie, and all his delegates. The special pen was a thin Sharpie which is provided and attached to the privacy screen with a cord. 

The first hiccup came when I went to get the ballot scanned and it was rejected. But the little old man told me to flip the ballot and try again. This time it went through. And that was it. I asked the little old man if I would get any confirmation, and he told me ""no"" and that the ""Cast"" button was there in case part of the ballot was wrong and I wanted to cast a partial of the parts that were correct. 

(As an aside, I am not a fan of this. Decades ago, I ran electronic elections using scannable ballots (with an OCR reader) and we ALWAYS were able to view the scanned ballot before submitting the final. This never seeing if the computer actually captured the data properly is very disturbing to me). 

I thanked the little old man and the slightly nervous Hispanic woman and wished them luck. I told them I heard things might get crazy in the afternoon and to hang in there. They both looked at me like I was a bit nutters (which is a fair cop, to be sure). My husband thinks my polling center might be quiet, but as I was leaving, I heard a poor guy going on about how he wasn't in the system and came all the way from Farmingdale... 

In any event, that was my adventure voting in a Primary for the first time ever. Thank you for indulging me.

1550;;9835;9835.0;love-and-attention;" Interesting post.

 Here is background on the Unification Church which has it's own shady legacy. This background is important in gaining a grasp on Soka Gakkai from a mirrored circumstance. While this isn't a reddit forum on the Unification Church, rather SGI, it's important to note the similarities and how tax exempt religious money can end up in the most bizarre realms, the religious component and it's adherents being little more than lucrative cash crops in which to invest in serious business, military, politics and unsavory operations in money laundering hot spots, illegal fuzzy grey zones and through it's international presence, access to multiple economies in which to divest earnings and overall general investments. 
The resemblances are uncanny. 

Unification church was founded by the leader of the Korean CIA (Colonel Pak) , initially used as a means to test North Korean brainwashing tactics on unsuspecting refugees in South Korea which had been displaced by North Korea's bold push south.  It went on to bribe the merchant/ruling classes through sexual misconduct via a ""light cleansing"" ceremony involving sexual rituals using bright lights...(cue photograph opportunities under the guise of purification rituals)  Wives and daughters of prominent businessmen and politicians were caught in blackmail schemes).

With the excelling growth and wealth through extortion, the Unification Church expanded into Japan,  funding Yakuza groups (including Black Dragon) in Japan to break up the burgeoning labor unions that were mushrooming up in response to the post era hardships and communist intervention. Strong arm groups would beat up, assassinate and harass labor union members into disbanding. These efforts staved off liberalization and labor reform against the zaibatsu corporate conglomerates(Japanese corporate families/ruling classes) during the reconstruction years. 

This was the Unification Church's toe hold in Japan that went on to control Japan's lucrative boat racing industry (major gambling industry) including a variety of other businesses as a spring board into the US and Europe. The church holdings including the World Trade Center in Okinawa. The Unification church also ran munitions factories working under joint projects with both Japanese and Korean military firms. 

Unification Church being staunchly anti communist, helped fuel American right wing politics with the founding of the Heritage Foundation in the United States including the ownership of the Washington Times ( was a leading supporter of the Nicaraguan contras and a chief apologist for the perpetrators of the arms-for-hostages scandal) and the purchase of Sheraton Hotels. Add the heavy investment in AP press services. Today it controls major fishing fleets on both coasts of the US, using True World Foods as fish brokers that control the vast market share of fish sold in Sushi restaurants throughout the US and Europe. The list of companies goes on. Literally hundreds of companies under different fronts, enjoying tax exempt status as religious corporations. To add, both Bush presidents have attended a variety of Unification Church rallies in support of the Church, including South Korea and Latin America...Bush named David Caprara, the head of Unification Church's American Family Coalition (another front group), as the director of VISTA (Volunteers in Service to America).

In South America,  the Unification Church group became one of Uruguay's leading foreign investors, owning the country's largest hotel, one of its leading banks (The national Bank of Uruguay) technically an ""offshore"" bank , the second-largest newspaper and two of the largest printing plants. Uruguay is primarily known for it's laundered criminal proceeds (money laundering) derived primarily from foreign activities related to drug trafficking organizations.  Uruguay is where Latin American drug money collectively goes to cleanse itself. 
http://articles.chicagotribune.com/1994-12-08/news/9412080055_1_unification-church-uruguay-rev-sun-myung-moon

In Paruguay, the Unification Church (1.5 million acres) and the Bush family (90,000 acres) purchased massive tracts of land housing Latin America's largest  aquafer, with the Moonie land purchased on both sides of the border both in Paruguay and Brazil, essentially creating a porous border between both countries. This Moonie purchase being made through the...Bank of Uruguay via a holding company called ""Victoria"". There is much information on this topic, especially regarding the geopolitical importance of this area with nearby Bolivia and it's drug production, Venezuela as an unfriendly state actor,  including important gas reserves/major illegal drug trade routes...

Unification Church holding companies committed resources and trade ties UNITA in Angola and RENAMO in Mozambique,  military factions. Moon’s fronts even maintained a dialogue with Pol Pot’s Khmer Rouge in Cambodia in regarding to (officially) business inroads. Interestingly, in North Korea, Unification Church owns the Fiat automobile plant including partial ownership of a luxury hotel in Pyongyang. 

Above all of this is the religious operational/marketing similarities between both the Unification Church and the Soka Gakkai. While there are key differences, the similarities should not be overlooked.

Both have charismatic leaders that have earned hundreds of ""honorary degrees"" with slick connections to developing world academic institutions. Both have leaders which are embued with magical powers by members. Both religions have piggybacked on traditional religious systems. Both have operations in over a hundred countries. Both have established universities and charter schools in their respective countries including other countries abroad. Both have purchased lucrative properties and real estate, divesting money into realms out of sight from it's members. Both lack financial oversight. Both have huge media enterprises and religious businesses run by members. Both leaders have had prolific book careers. One huge commonality is the visiting and meeting with world leaders as proof of importance, including Noreiga. Both utilize brain washing techniques such as love bombing, aggressive witnessing or Shakabuku techniques and put on expensive festivals with song and dance performances utilizing choreographed routines very similar to that of North Korea. 
One huge commonality is regarding politics, whether the formation of an actual political party or the deep insertion into right wing governments throughout the world...Both at the political level have supported  military policies versus soft power proposals (troops in Iraq). Both pressure for purchasing magazines and newspapers including donations. Both utilize ""campaigns"" in which arbitrary goals are set and finally, though the list could probably go on, both have had firm ""interfaith dialogue"" reaching out to other religious traditions in a bid to develop relevancy, acceptance and deepen roots in the community.

Before I forget, both utilizing ""religious retreats""  or ""brainwashing reeducation centers"" in which religious doctrine is reinforced, with heavy focus on both ""Mentor and Sensei"" or in the case of the Moonies ""True Father"". Secretly, many SGI members have harbored the idea that Ikeda is Nichiren reincarnated, a thought likely indoctrinated by leadership. With the Unification Church, Rev. Moon is seen as Jesus reincarnated... Both have their own key principle tome or piece of literature in which to cement the culture and expansion of the respective organizations. 
Soka Gakkai has ""Human Revolution"" while Unification Church have ""Divine Principle""....

Yeah, it's pretty creepy. Now back to reading segments of this post.

The new diagnosis recognized that a mismatch between one’s birth gender and identity was not necessarily pathological, notes pediatric endocrinologist Norman Spack, a founder of the gender clinic at Boston Children’s Hospital. It shifted the emphasis in treatment from fixing a disorder to resolving distress over the mismatch.

 DSM-5 dropped the former term describing a pathology, and replaced it with the latter classification, which could be used to diagnose distress caused by gender mismatch.""

If UBI were to pass, The federal Government would just cut other programs, as would states. In California, the Lottery was going to be a big boon to School system as all proceeds were to go to Education. But all that happened what the State budget got cut more than the increases from the gambling revenue. So funding ended up worse off than before the lottery.

The same thing would happen here. If people got $1000 a month in UBI, they would cut medicaid, SNAP(formerly food stamps), housing assistance (Section 8), and other benefits. People would end up worse off. And it incentivizes not working. We need to cut the work week to 30 hours with the same pay, and eventually to 20 hours for the same pay. This would require more workers and make some gains toward jobs lost to robots and AI. This is what we did during the Industrial revolution. Instead of working sun up to sun down, we changed to a 40 hour work week. We banned child labor. This created more job demand, which caused wages to increase. We are going to have to do something similar. Everyone should enjoy the gains of robotics and AI, not just the corporations and companies. Lowering the work week hours for the same wages would make gains for everyone, and it would not be a handout. It would still incentivize work.

1588;;10235;10235.0;Oblique9043;"Keep in mind this book came out in 1907 and that the practices of Freemasonry all comes from the Jews and that's not even a secret. The Freemason's are just another group they infiltrated/created to hide behind so that the public could put a face on the enemy while they stay hidden. They've done this in Russia, Great Britain, Germany, the Vatican, Israel and America and that's just what I know.  


They do this division tactic called the Hegelian dialectic where they define what each side is, people pick teams and then they push each side into conflict to create the desired result. Which is the step by step control of the world and it's systems. The Vatican does not hate the Freemason's, it's all pro wrestling. They all dress the same as Yahweh told the Levite priests to dress in the Old Testament. That's not a coincidence. Their human sacrifices are from the wars they start.  


If you look at this story through the lens that the Freemason's and the Vatican are on the same side, then that means the REAL agenda is a combination of the narratives in this story. That being a world takeover and an attempt to preserve Catholicism/Christianity due to fear of extinction. The results of that look suspiciously similar to what we are looking at today with Trump and his Evangelical support. He is scaring the shit out of them and telling them that this is do or die. Either I stay President and you and Jesus survives or I get impeached and the liberals take to the streets and kill all of you. This is the level we are at right now and I have PERSONALLY witnessed this kind of thinking my entire life. Think about what this story is trying to get you to believe versus what the truth is. Then ask yourselves why would they want you to believe this so bad? Are they trying to tell you their plans? Or maybe they're trying to trick you. This idea that the end times would be full of nihilists and atheists who just hate Christians for no reason and they just murder them all the time has been the prevailing idea since these end times prophecies were said. Partially because this stuff did happen throughout history. But do you really see that happening now?  


What possible reason would modern people want to take out Christians and murder them in the streets? Well, their support for someone like Trump might lead people in that direction if that sort of thing was possible, wouldn't it? If Trump causes the kinds of things I think he is, then it will all be because of the support he got from Christians who think he's practically God or at least doing the work of God. And why do they believe that? Why are they willing to throw away basic morals and truth itself for a man like Trump? Because they have been scared their ENTIRE lives into this position. They've been told that some man like the Antichrist in this book is going to come and persecute and murder them all and their religion. They thought Obama was this man, and you know what? Maybe he is. Maybe they scared them for 8 years with Obama to get them to vote in Trump, show their ugly faces, the people who represent the absolute worst of America and Christianity, then make it look like this is who America is and what Christianity stands for. What better trick could you pull than that to demonize Christianity and America than to put these people out there as the face of those two things? They're either using them to take complete control and keep it or they're using them to take just enough control and cause just enough chaos to expose them for how utterly dangerous and immoral they are and then taking them out and demonizing everything they were associated with will be so easy, they won't even have to enforce it. I am leaning towards the latter but I truly don't know, it could be a LONG road to that latter.  


But in the meantime, Trump seems poised to make himself leader of the Christians to go to war with the world. You think it's also a coincidence that Russia recently declared it was a Christian country and that the man who Trump stole one of his Coat of Arms from was the Ambassador to the USSR under FDR (who was a 33rd degree mason who commissioned the building of the Pentagon), never said a bad word about them, praised them and claimed that Christians should openly embrace the Soviet Union? Looks like they figured out it would be easier to appeal to our hatred and selfishness with capitalism and greed than it would be to appeal to the ""social justice"" stuff.  


These Christians are convinced that they're the good guys and if they don't take over than Satan will and they are defending God himself. They'll think that the whole time their fellow citizens are getting jailed and murdered in the streets for being ""un-American"" or against God simply for not taking up arms and killing people and if you think that can't happen here you're a fool.

That study only gauges an income tax VS debt financing, and it doesn't study what happens when you go to the middle of these two options and choose a VAT and other taxes that don't directly impact household consumption.

In the middle of the night, they held a 15 minute vote. At the end of 15 minutes, that act had been voted down. But instead of closing and recording the vote, they kept it open for three hours while republican leaders were reported to have threatened and bribed other republicans to change their votes.

After three hours, they got enough Representatives to change their votes and finally closed the voting with the bill passed by 220 to 215. And then it went on to pass the Senate 54-44 because back then the filibuster was not being abused.


But wait, there's more. When the bill was being created, the rules committee prevented almost every amendment from being debated. That is why the amendments  to negotiate for lower prices and allowing Americans to import cheaper drugs from Canada never had a chance of being included.


And when it went to conference with the Senate, Democrats were excluded from deliberations, even being physically prevented from entering the conference room where it was being debated by senior republicans.


And let's not forget that one of the main authors of the bill was also negotiating for a multimillion dollar lobbying position with the pharmaceutical industry when he was writing it.

And then the bill came to the floor and Representatives were given less than 24 hours to read a bill almost half as long as the Obamacare bill. Can you say no one read the bill?


And one last thing. The bill was originally projected to cost $400 billion over the first 10 years. Shortly after passage, that cost estimate was revised to $1.2 trillion dollars, all unfunded by the way.

1825;;7609;7609.0;xxxJakkxxx;" I played with the numbers a bit. I used Google's tracking of election results for it. I did this for Hillary, Trump, and Johnson.

 If we give each candidate the percentage of electoral votes from each state based on the votes they got in those states

 * Hillary - 257.06 Votes
 * Trump - 253.38 Votes
 * Johnson - 17.66 Votes

Now, because we can't split up the electoral votes like that and have to figure a way to give whole numbers, I did standard rounding on each state's votes for the candidates. It changes the numbers a bit.

 * Hillary - 261 Votes
 * Trump - 258 Votes
 * Johnson - 9 Votes

Looking at these numbers, Hillary would clearly be ahead but neither candidate would have the actual majority of 270 that is required to win the Presidency. That law would have to be changed or, it appears, that every election would end in congress choosing.

 Also, there is an odd bit.

 * Those 3 account for 96% of the votes in the country.
 * 96% of the total electoral votes is 516 votes
 * Those 3 received a total of 528 electoral votes (by this method of giving out electoral votes)
 * 528 electoral votes is 98% of the electoral votes
 * 96% of the population would account for 98% of the votes

Feelings doesn't equal reality. If it makes you feel better, he's removed the thing about banning muslims from his campaign site. Despite the fact that hes said earlier that he wasn't intent on banning all muslims and its not about religion, but banning people from countries with a high risk of terrorists...which do happen to be countries with mostly muslim population. Trump isn't one to qualify his statements or word them carefully to avoid scaring anyone, and you should take his off the cuff remarks with a grain of salt.

As for the unsolicited kissing thing, thats simply a greeting in some cultures. Do you need to sign a contract to go in for the kiss or is it ok to go for a kiss based on body language? What if you read them wrong? Yes his comments were crude, but I find that all less gross than Hillary threatening and intimidating women who claim that they were raped by Bill Clinton.

Your identity politics allowed discrimination against transgendered people twice now under Trump, and you and your kids are no safer as a result of it.  

I hope nothing bad ever happens to you or your daughter, but thanks to your constant fear of nonexistent dangers m2f transgendered people will be using the men's bathroom in a skirt and we all know that eventually a couple are going to get the shit kicked out of them, so thanks for making the world a shittier place for someone else's daughter.

1909;;12758;12758.0;Jebediah_Primm;"The Drifting Wave

A group of sailors, privateers, navy men, and pirates dedicated to teaching and passing on ancient laws and secrets of the sea and even parts of history that must not be known. They are secret and do not wish to be openly known to the world for the ancient knowledge they contain is often hidden to make sure it does not flow freely into the hands of those that will make ill-use of it. They are everywhere and what they know encompasses everything. 

Eternity

A group entirely dedicated to finding the Philosopher’s Stone for their own evil and mysterious deeds. They are known of almost nowhere due to their merciless tactics to cover up their acts. Fear is the only way people know of them, brands and marks of a closed fist with light escaping through its fingers are the only thing to prove the groups existence. All else is story told by bards in brothels or even members themselves. 

The Golden Antiqouram

A group entirely dedicated to the preservation and acquisition of ancient artifacts and items of historical significance. Making sure people have a past to look on is their main goal. They are open about their existence and while gaining membership can be difficult it is not impossible. Members must be able to make the decision of artifact over all else. Nothing is more important. Not wildlife, nor yourself, nor other people, or even civilization. Their only aim is to preserve. 

Uncle Theo’s Awe Inspiring and Stupendous Cirque de Magi

Led by the illustrious Uncle Theo himself the Cirque travels from city to town to colony performing their amazing acts. Going once doesn’t do the show justice as they have so many acts and wonders to go on for days. Though in the underbelly of most cities people know them for different reasons. Heists and thefts of legend, work for nobles, and political assassinations are common jobs for members of the Cirque. Uncle Theo often claims not to know of any illicit work being done by any of his people and that if it was happening he would stop it. Whichever part of the Cirque de Magi you wish to see, go and watch a show for whatever reasons, over or under the table, you have. 

The Nameless Ones

A group entirely dedicated to doing good at any cost. They are not controlled by money, power, or authority. Their own structure is vague even to many members as they don’t wish anyone one person to control all. Revolutions, monster hunting, investigation work, whatever is needed of them is where they are. Whether you ask them to show up or not, they are their. Their ears are everywhere and their agents ready.

What about TERFs? Especially TERFs that are women. Are they still beyond reproach? Can only women call TERFs out for being trans exclusionary? 

If so, how are women not just gatekeeping in all the ways that men allegedly do?

In summary, yes these democrats voted against importing cheaper drugs.  Most made an excuse regarding ""safety standards."" Also, the vote was non-binding as it simply advises the CBO how to allocate its money. These democrats received at least hundreds of thousands of dollars from pharmaceutical manufacturers. 

A more accurate post would be: 13 Democrats vote to not look in to the import of cheap drugs from Canada.  These democrats were paid hundreds of thousands of dollars from pharmaceutical manufacturers since 2011.

I still think it's pathetic of them to have voted against this amendment. The article nitpicks the original claim and shouldn't have rated it Mostly False. 

Edit: These Democrats did vote in favor of a similar amendment, but that one failed because it didn't have Republican crossover. Should they get credit for that vote?

2074;;75;;LikesMoonPies;"First of all, as the OP article points out, the amendment in question was only a budget item that wouldn't have done anything to make it legal or easier for Americans to buy lower cost drugs from Canada.  It wouldn't even have been voted on by both houses.  The only thing it seems to have accomplished is dissent and in-fighting and mudslinging about people like Corey Booker who voted for Wydens offering. 

There have been attempts in the past to allow this and they all fail because they don't seriously tackle the problem of safety and implementation.  

[Booker cites a lack of specifics in the amendment addressing safety standards.:](https://theintercept.com/2017/01/12/cory-booker-joins-senate-republicans-to-kill-measure-to-import-cheaper-medicine-from-canada/) 

> In a statement to the media after the vote, Booker’s office said he supports the importation of prescription drugs but that “any plan to allow the importation of prescription medications should also include consumer protections that ensure foreign drugs meet American safety standards. I opposed an amendment put forward last night that didn’t meet this test.”  

The article also includes an older quote by Tim Pawlenty regarding arguments about safety: 

> “My first response to that is show me the dead Canadians. Where are the dead Canadians?” former Minnesota Gov. Tim Pawlenty, a Republican, once asked during his own push to allow for importation.

I keep seeing Pawlenty's sentiment repeated throughout this thread along with the assumption that  drugs sold from Canada to the USA are coming out of the same factories as drugs sold in the USA.  

Neither of these things are necessarily true.   

Safety is a legitimate concern. 

Even for drugs sent to the USA from Canada. 

[In this article, Consumer Reports notes that:](http://www.consumerreports.org/cro/news/2011/10/save-money-by-ordering-drugs-from-canada-not-so-fast/index.htm)

> Canadian pharmacies that ship prescription medication to the U.S. aren’t subject to Canadian regulatory authority, according to the U.S. Department of Justice.     

Pawlenty doesn't have to find dead Canadians to find victims.  

One good example is the case of CanadaDrugs.com LP.  [It even requires valid prescriptions from a licensed provider](https://www.canadadrugs.com/new-order) - one of the few (only?) specifics in the Sanders amendment.  

In 2012, [the FDA started trying to crack down on this company](http://www.fda.gov/ICECI/EnforcementActions/WarningLetters/2012/ucm321068.htm) for instances of shipping substandard and fake drugs to purchasers in the USA as well as drugs unapproved for sale in this country.  

[This article, which details problems with thousands of online websites ](https://www.drugwatch.com/2012/10/09/fda-cracks-down-on-thousands-of-illegal-online-pharmacies/) enabling Americans to buy imported, cheaper, drugs, cites CanadaDrugs.com LP as one of the biggest problems:  

> Three main companies — CanadaDrugs.com, Eyal Bar Oz and Arkadiy Kisin/White Forest Solutions — were linked to most of the 4,100 illegal pharmacies, according to Bloomberg Businessweek. They received warning letters from the FDA, stating that their websites were offering unapproved drugs to U.S. consumers...  

While that article goes on to say that the most common sales are illegal versions of ED drugs,  this article points out that CanadaDrugs.com LP, which we are using as our example, [was selling counterfeit cancer drugs to US consumers.](http://www.fiercepharma.com/special-report/6-chasing-canadadrugs-com)      

Even with all of this, Canadian regulatory authorities still allowed this company to operate in Canada.   Two years later, [Health Canada](http://www.safemedicines.org/2014/06/canadadrugscom-lp-wholesale-license-suspended-by-health-canada-6-13-14.html) finally suspended the company's wholesale license; but: 

>  they are still able to distribute medication through their chain of retail websites, because retail pharmacy is regulated by the provincial and territorial governments.  

That article also adds osteoporosis drugs, Prolia and Aclastia, to the growing list of counterfeit drugs sold in the USA by this company.  

[Here is the website of another international seller of lower cost Canadian drugs](http://www.canadianpharmacymeds.com/aboutus.asp)   

This shows that these repetitive claims that *these drugs are coming out of USA factories* is not necessarily true:  

> Prescription medication orders are filled and shipped from approved fulfillment centers around the world including, but not limited to, Canada, Singapore, United Kingdom, New Zealand, Turkey, Mauritius, India, Australia, and the United States. 

>The prescription items in your order may be filled and shipped from any one of the above jurisdictions. The products are sourced from various countries including, but not limited to, Canada, United Kingdom, New Zealand, Turkey, India, Australia, and the United States.

Now, do I think Canada looks out for its citizens and Canadians have safe drugs?  Sure.  

Do I think the FDA tries to ensure drug safety for Americans?  Of course.  

But, Health Canada doesn't have any authority in the USA, and the FDA doesn't have any authority in Canada.  Clearly, each are sovereign nations.   

That's the problem with allowing the purchase by pharmacies and individuals of imported drugs.  Sellers can exploit these loopholes where they aren't being regulated by *any* safety authority.  

This amendment is not attempting to address any of the real issues in actually implementing this for people.

2075;;76;;jellicle;"The problem here is that accurately assessing what is going in requires one to pay attention to the overall legislative process, which Politifact does not do.

If one is presented with a bill that makes college free for every American (and also requires all first-born babies to be placed into woodchippers and ground into hamburger), and one votes against it, is it fair to characterize that vote as ""voted against free college""?  That's the essential dilemma here.

In this case, the situation is:

- Cory Booker (et al.) are happy to vote for any drug import law that has no chance of passing

- Booker will not vote for any drug import law that has a chance of passing

- Booker will vote for any drug import law that has a bunch of conditions on it such that no drugs could actually be imported

- Booker will not vote for any drug import law that does not have those conditions

Given that overall fact pattern, is it fair to suggest that Booker is actually in favor of drugs being imported?  I mean, look, as Politifact notes, he voted for this other amendment.  But that doesn't tell the whole story, does it?  That's actively misleading (and intended to be).

Politifact's answer, which suggests that all these Senators from large-pharmaceutical-industry states are actually in favor of drug importation, is deeply misleading.  I rate Politifact's answer **Mostly False**.

2112;;113;;John_Phantomhive;"Logic and critical thinking certainly helped me in my faith crisis, but not the way you'd have liked.
Critical thinking and the overabundance of Logical fallacies and intellectual dishonesty is what turned me away from the claims against the gospel.

You appeal to God near the end. God also showed me the truth, and that's not invalid just because it's not what you see as the truth. God's ways are not our ways.

I suppose it could be amended as, as is so often the case, ""Those who think differently than me must be intellectually defective""

There are certainly a great many issues in the leadership, we can both agree on that. But the leadership doesn't determine the truth despite how much they'd like that.


You do not get to decide truth, logic, or the will of God. Every single one of these arguments can be construed right back at your own belief system because it's what every belief system says about the others.

2114;;115;;ACatNamedBalthazar;"Ever notice how when racists face accusations of racism they might respond by pointing out their black friend? My point being, either racists lie about being racist, or they don't understand they are racist. Nullifying the ""results test"" is the judicial equivalent of taking racists at their word, rather than acknowledging they are engaging in racist practices.

So basically the answer here is for white people to save themselves from their racist tendencies? It follows that if white racists enact racially discriminatory voting practices, racial minorities' voting power is minimized to rectify the racial discrimination, accordingly we must look to white people to save civil rights.

According to CNN, the annual medical cost for all trans soldiers is 5.6 million of out the 824.7 billion dollar military budget.

Rounding up, this is 0.000007% of the annual budget.

Trump launched 59 tomahawk missles at Syria a few months ago, and the efficacy of that strike is highly scrutinized.

One tomahawk missle costs about $1 million. 6 of those missles costs more than the cost to support all trans people in the military.

So, ""cost"" is just an excuse. The real reason is political posturing/discrimination.

It reminds me of when people get all whipped up about welfare recipients, but welfare costs are an insignificant drop in the budget bucket.

2188;;189;;ContraVern;"&gt;The study estimates that between 30 and 140 new hormone treatments could be initiated a year and 25 to 130 gender transition-related surgeries could be utilized a year among active component service members. Additional health care costs could range between $2.4 million and $8.4 million, representing an approximate 0.13-percent increase.

&gt;In terms of readiness, RAND estimates that 10 to 130 active component members each year could have reduced deployability as a result of gender transition-related treatments. This amount is negligible relative to the 102,500 nondeployable soldiers in the Army alone in 2015, 50,000 of them in the active component.

&gt;Problematic alcohol use within the United States military has been linked to substantial financial and productivity losses. Data from 2006 revealed that excessive alcohol consumption cost the U.S. military $1.12 billion per year (Harwood et al. 2009). Regarding medical expenditures, studies have found that excessive alcohol use by military members results in an annual cost of $425 million. Excessive drinking within the military is estimated to result in a loss of 320,000 work days and 34,400 arrests per year, half of which are for driving under the influence. Finally, these data indicate that each year excessive alcohol use results in 10,400 active-duty military being unable to deploy and 2,200 being separated from service duty.

Alternative Fact #1: Only people who are transitioning are considered transgender by the US military.

Actual Fact #1: This is wrong. In fact, here's the definition of transgender from the military's own handbook:

>Transgender Service member. A Service member who has received a medical diagnosis indicating that gender transition is medically necessary, including any Service member who intends to begin transition, is undergoing transition, or has completed transition and is stable in the preferred gender.

Alternative Fact #2: People with asthma and ADHD are disallowed, so of course transgender people should also be barred!

Actual Fact #2: That's false equivalency, a logical fallacy. [Source.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/False_equivalence) ADHD inhibits one's ability to pay attention. Asthma makes it difficult to breathe. Being transgender doesn't impede one's ability to run, fight, or think rationally. Full stop.

Alternative Fact #3: Being transgender is in the DSM-V, so it should be something that's screened for!

Actual Fact #3: You're thinking of [gender dysphoria](https://www.psychiatry.org/patients-families/gender-dysphoria/what-is-gender-dysphoria), and it is not the same thing as being transgender. In fact, they have separate definitions in the US DoD Transgender Service in the US Military Handbook. Being transgender is *not* in the DSM-V.

I've heard plenty of angry old people claim it is, and reddit users who want to tell me trans is a mental illness, and the suicide rate among trans means they can't serve, the military isn't a place for pc social experiments, etc. etc.

Just what the fuck is this presidency if not a big social experiment? We put a megalomaniac in charge because ""he's a businessman not a politician"" and ""he's anti-establishment.""

So, you want it both ways then? DJT is good because he's not the status quo/ but trans is bad because it's not the status quo. Tell me which position depends more on a level headed approach, and logic instead of emotion? The troops who do their jobs? Or the Commander in Chief who can declare fucking war?

You can talk about trans people's suicide rates, but you cannot separate those suicides from the families, and surrounding communities who made them feel they were not welcomed because of being trans. Trans people do have a higher rate of suicide attempts, as do gay kids- and kids is a very important word here. When you're a kid, you have a lot less power. When you're a kid who doesn't find love & acceptance within your own home/community- you're going to suffer more. Tell me how well you'd hold up.

Anyone serving under this admin ought to be very concerned. Trump is a lunatic who can and very well may start a fucking war.

Talk all your armchair general bullshit about that, but  are you willing to serve yourself? If a trans person is, who the hell are you to say they're unfit if you are unwilling?

2308;;309;;FrodosCurlingIron;"Here's my humble take, coming from a current military member. 

When I first heard about the banning of transgender individuals today, I was annoyed. In a time where the military (especially certain career fields that are hemorrhaging people to the civilian world) are tired and worn out from the past 15+ years of war, we can use all the help we can get...turning away anybody willing to serve seems like a stupid idea.

After some thought and discussion with my co-workers, I started to lean the other direction--we don't allow people with certain levels of color blindness, diabetes, and certain mental issues from serving, so why does no one consider that discrimination? It doesn't seem like a good idea to have someone would requires periodic insulin shots (or hormone therapy, in the transgender case) fighting on the front line.

I realized that this opens up a conversation regarding military accession standards--who is allowed to join, and who isn't. The career field I serve in is one of the more restrictive--many medical conditions would make my job very difficult (i.e. color blindness), but every job like this requires an army (pun intended) of support staff to get things done. 

For example: I've got 3 enlisted troops that work in our squadron that essentially do paperwork all day, keeping track of the operators' currencies and administrative requirements. We have a computer resources shop with another 10 airmen that fix network issues and keep our systems up to date.

I can't think of any reason a color-blind, or diabetic, or transgender, or even a kid who smoked pot once back in high school but was too honest on his enlistment paperwork would be unable to serve the military AT LEAST in some capacity. The military needs to become more flexible in who it allows to join. And trust me, we need all the help we can get.";370;1.0;Megathread: Trump Announces Ban on Transgender Military Service;https://www.reddit.com/r/politics/comments/6pogx7/megathread_trump_announces_ban_on_transgender/;0

2497;;498;;they_call_me_Maybe;"It's super subtle but that point actually helps what I'm getting at. My point is gender isn't some inherent identity that pervades the body, but more the complex social interactions that we build up over our lives. For neurological and genetic reasons, some people spend their lives receiving and sending cues in a way that they build their gender opposite to what their anatomy would normally cause that process to happen. Gender isn't a concrete thing, it's a way of living in the world, so in other words it's more of an action. But just because the action contradicts the object performing it, doesn't invalidate the action. The object without the action is just the body, and we all agree, even the trans person, that the body is a certain gender. But the action is the part of that body we call the person, and that person feels like them just like you feel like you. 

The hard but important thing to keep in mind is that just because it's anatomically incorrect, you can't say for sure how all else it might be incorrect. These people feel as much like their gender as you feel like yours.

I think the difficulty here is detaching the sense of ""i'm being discriminated for being transgendered"" and the very normal and accepted limitations of who is in the military based on the perceived special needs of those people.  Being barred from military service for having hemherroids isnt ""discriminating"" against people with hemherroids just as barring someone who is transgendered based on the same criteria wouldnt be discriminating against them.

(5) Medically capable of performing duties without aggravation of existing physical defects or medical conditions.

Disqualifying Medical Conditions

If you have a penis, you are male. If you have a vagina, you are female.  No matter what mental gymnastics or wordplay you throw around, that is a fact.

Just because a woman feels like a man inside doesn't make her a man.  A man mutilating his genitals does not make him a woman.  All he has is a mutilated penis, not a vagina.

How is it any different than somebody saying that they feel like a cat inside.  They can glue fur on themselves and have a prosthetic tail and ears put on.  That does not make them a cat.

Is transgender considered a mental illness? If then isn't it obvious that we shouldn't allow that in the military?

2698;;699;;zjs;"> Is transgender considered a mental illness?

Here's an [answer from the American Psychological Association](http://www.apa.org/topics/lgbt/transgender.aspx):

> A psychological state is considered a mental disorder only if it causes significant distress or disability. Many transgender people do not experience their gender as distressing or disabling, which implies that identifying as transgender does not constitute a mental disorder. For these individuals, the significant problem is finding affordable resources, such as counseling, hormone therapy, medical procedures and the social support necessary to freely express their gender identity and minimize discrimination. Many other obstacles may lead to distress, including a lack of acceptance within society, direct or indirect experiences with discrimination, or assault. These experiences may lead many transgender people to suffer with anxiety, depression or related disorders at higher rates than nontransgender persons.
> 
> According to the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (DSM-5), people who experience intense, persistent gender incongruence can be given the diagnosis of ""gender dysphoria."" Some contend that the diagnosis inappropriately pathologizes gender noncongruence and should be eliminated. Others argue that it is essential to retain the diagnosis to ensure access to care. The International Classification of Diseases (ICD) is under revision and there may be changes to its current classification of intense persistent gender incongruence as ""gender identity disorder.""

"" Manning is an outspoken advocate for transgender rights. During her incarceration, she went on a five-day hunger strike to demand gender confirmation treatment. Manning, who was assigned male at birth but identifies as female, ended her strike after the Army complied with her request. 

Chase Strangio, a staff attorney at the American Civil Liberties Union and one of Manning’s lawyers, slammed Trump in a flurry of tweets Wednesday that called the ban “cruel” and “illegal.”""

2759;;760;;sdfsdfsdfdsffff;">The Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, Fifth Edition (DSM-5) is the 2013 update to the American Psychiatric Association's (APA) classification and diagnostic tool. In the United States the DSM serves as a universal authority for psychiatric diagnoses. Treatment recommendations, as well as payment by health care providers, are often determined by DSM classifications, so the appearance of a new version has significant practical importance.
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DSM-5

>Gender dysphoria is classified as a disorder under dual role transvestism in the 2017 ICD-10 CM.[7] GID was reclassified to gender dysphoria by the DSM-5.[8] Some transgender people and researchers support declassification of GID because they say the diagnosis pathologizes gender variance, reinforces the binary model of gender,[9] and can result in stigmatization of transgender individuals.[8] The official reclassification as gender dysphoria in the DSM-5 may help resolve some of these issues, because the term gender dysphoria applies only to the discontent experienced by some persons resulting from gender identity issues.[8] The American Psychiatric Association, publisher of the DSM-5, states that **""gender nonconformity is not in itself a mental disorder. The critical element of gender dysphoria is the presence of clinically significant distress associated with the condition.""**[10]
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gender_dysphoria

Here you go. From Wikipedia. There's a big difference between someone who is willing to look up information and an insane person who argues from a position of complete ignorance and still thinks they're right. 

You don't actually know what logic, facts, and reality are. A dog is considered a dog because of scientific classification that distinguishes it as a dog. Mental illness is considered mental illness by the same standards. AKA: Scientific classification that determines that standard. Where do you think those terms and definitions come from in the first place?

And to think that only took five seconds to look into. The power of actually using your brain and looking up shit. It's pretty amazing isn't it?

And this is further backed that once gender dysphoria is treated, the significant distress goes away. That's the thing about mental illness or illnesses in general. They're treatable and can be cured (whether medical science has access to a cure is a different story). There is no cure to transgenderism because it's how a person is born, just like how people are born gay, or brown, or a woman, etc.

Gender dysphoria is a condition that arises when a person's perceived gender does not match their physical body. It can be treated and cured, thus it is a disease. Transgenderism cannot.

The entire fault with your argument is that you do not understand what a mental disease is in the first place. But you insist that you do because you *feel* that you do. That's an irrational train of thought, therefore you are the one who's mentally ill. If you were a rational person, you'd make sure that you actually had some idea of what the hell you're talking about if you're going to insist on using words and classification created by the scientific community in the first place to argue against them.";370;1.0;Megathread: Trump Announces Ban on Transgender Military Service;https://www.reddit.com/r/politics/comments/6pogx7/megathread_trump_announces_ban_on_transgender/;1

No, Gender dysphoria is not simply ""unease or dissatisfaction"" with the sex one was assigned at birth. It is significant distress and impairment related to or caused by the mismatch between one's identified gender and that which they were assigned at birth.

Why don't I just quote the APA and their DSM-V for you:
https://www.psychiatry.org/patients-families/gender-dysphoria/what-is-gender-dysphoria

>The Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (DSM-5) provides for one overarching diagnosis of gender dysphoria with separate specific criteria for children and for adolescents and adults.

>In adolescents and adults gender dysphoria diagnosis involves a difference between one’s experienced/expressed gender and assigned gender, **and significant distress or problems functioning**. It lasts at least six months and is shown by at least two of the following:

...

>In children, gender dysphoria diagnosis involves at least six of the following **and an associated significant distress or impairment in function**, lasting at least six months.

Note the bolded sections **requiring** ""significant distress or problems functioning"" and ""significant distress or impairment in function.""

>We can spin it to make it more modern or politically correct, but it doesn't really change the substance.

It's not being ""spun"" and it wasn't changed due to ""political correctness."" Only a subset of transgender people experience the distress and pathology related to them being transgender.

You know what also strives to make things more ""modern?"" Science. You know, like psychiatry and clinical psychology.

>So essentially, someone who is transgender has gender dysphoria which is a mental disorder. 

Again, wrong.

>However, there are degrees of impact and not everyone who is trans has severe depression, schizophrenia, suicidal tendencies, etc. But, the rate of developing such symptoms is incredibly higher than the non-trans community because, well, they have a mental disorder.

> K, where in the DSM-IV does it say that gender dysphoria is the same thing as just being transgender or that all transgender people have gender dysphoria?

Here is the DSM-IV definition of GID/Gender Dysphoria:

>Gender Incongruence (in Adolescents or Adults) [1]

>A. **A marked incongruence between one’s experienced/expressed gender and assigned gender, of at least 6 months duration, as manifested by 2* or more of the following indicators:** 

>1. a marked incongruence between one’s experienced/expressed gender and primary and/or secondary sex characteristics (or, in young adolescents, the anticipated secondary sex characteristics) 

>2. a strong desire to be rid of one’s primary and/or secondary sex characteristics because of a marked incongruence with one’s experienced/expressed gender (or, in young adolescents, a desire to prevent the development of the anticipated secondary sex characteristics)

>3. a strong desire for the primary and/or secondary sex characteristics of the other gender

>4. a strong desire to be of the other gender (or some alternative gender different from one’s assigned gender)

>5. a strong desire to be treated as the other gender (or some alternative gender different from one’s assigned gender)

>6. a strong conviction that one has the typical feelings and reactions of the other gender (or some alternative gender different from one’s assigned gender)

Pick two indicators and tell me that the definition of Gender Dysphoria in the DSM-IV, as you asked, is not the same thing as defining transgenderism.

>You have no idea what you are talking about.

You are making arguments out of the DSM-V while asking for counter-arguments out of the DSM-IV because you are the one who has no idea what you are talking about.

Here is the diagnostic criteria listed for Gender Identity Disorder in IV-TR:
http://psychnews.psychiatryonline.org/doi/10.1176/pn.38.14.0032

>A. A strong and persistent cross-gender identification (not merely a desire for any perceived cultural advantages of being the other sex). In children, the disturbance is manifested by four (or more) of the following:

>1. repeatedly stated desire to be, or insistence that he or she is, the other sex
>2. in boys, preference for cross-dressing or simulating female attire; in girls, insistence on wearing only stereotypical masculine clothing
>3. strong and persistent preferences for cross-sex roles in make-believe play or persistent fantasies of being the other sex
>4. intense desire to participate in the stereotypical games and pastimes of the other sex
>5. strong preference for playmates of the other sex

>B. Persistent discomfort with his or her sex or sense of inappropriateness in the gender role of that sex.

>C. The disturbance is not concurrent with a physical intersex condition.

>D. The disturbance causes clinically significant distress or impairment in social, occupational, or other important areas of functioning.

Note B, C, and D.

And based on how your quote is structured, with the criteria beginning with the letter ""A,"" I suspect that even DSM IV had similar criteria that you have deliberately chosen to leave out.

Regardless, what matters is the current DSM V, which I quoted earlier. You conveniently ignore it and any other information and facts which don't conform to your a priori bias and bigotry.

As I previously wrote, I assumed you were referring to the DSM-IV-TR, because the IV was codified in 1994 and hasn't been used since 2000. You're making arguments on a 23 year old manual that has had two major revisions in the past two decades. This is obtuse cherry picking and confirmation bias.

The criteria for Gender Identity Disorder in IV-TR clearly notes distress and impairment as requirements for the diagnosis. There's a clear evolution of understanding and conceptualization concerning gender dysphoria and transgenderism.

Furthermore, I'm still suspicious that you've selectively quoted from IV and left out a section that also notes criteria requiring distress and impairment for the diagnosis. I just can't be due, because neither I nor any other clinician has used IV in nearly two decades.

>Unlike you, I and probably everybody else in this thread understands that the DSM-V was updated to change the definition of gender dysophoria to a more politically correct definition.  

Prove it. Do you have a source to substantiate this? 

Why is it that the American Medical Association, American Psychological Association, American Psychiatric Association and American Academy of Pediatrics all agree with me and not you?

I'm guessing you'll respond that this is all because of ""political correctness"" continue making claims without sources or evidence.

You are absolutely wrong on multiple counts and it's very clear that your positions are motivated by bigotry.

E.g. 
>It's amazing how bigoted the left can be with their incredibly low expectations of black people. If you can't secure the proper ID for yourself, you probably shouldn't be voting and should instead be sorting yourself out. Reading your posts had led me to believe you do in fact have some sort of soft bigotry towards black people. Why do you think they are so incapable? I believe that black people are equal to white people, it is their choices that define them, not their skin color. You seem to think the opposite.

Ok, says who?

The American Medical Association, American Psychiatric Association, American Psychological Association, and American Academy of Pediatrics?

2871;;872;;Terrible_Detective45;">Making clear, logical arguments for conservative positions that half the country supports = bigot. K  

A. Your arguments are not logical because they are clearly either lies or denials of basic facts.

>>this is so fucking stupid it's actually unbelievable. Do you genuinely think everybody is treated the same way, regardless of skin colour? 

>I would hope so. I live in America though so I can't speak for Canada. The only systematic differences for different races that I see are things like affirmative action which gives undue advantage to black people.   

B. Just because lots of people support something doesn't mean it isn't racist or otherwise bigoted.

And let's see some of your other ""clear, logical,"" totally not racist arguments:

>Doubt it. The biggest thing holding black people down is the welfare state which encourages fatherless households. 
>
>Your attitude is also extremely poor, you seem angry and emotional.  

...

>Dude you've got to be kidding me. Let's brake this down. For starters, where did I deny racism exists? I know racism exists, there are a lot of racist people in the world, I've met racist people in my lifetime. There is a massive difference between racist people existing and entire systems being ""racist"", that's what I'm refuting here.
>
>The outcomes of the welfare state in the US are clear as day, welfare was a neutron bomb dropped on black communities that incentivized single motherhood. I'm not sure if you're aware, but 1 parent family's generally don't produce the best outcomes for their children. That is not disputable. Instead of dismissing those on the right you should listen to their arguments and attempt to refute them individually. Here's a gem from brilliant economist Thomas Sowell: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ePCt9OQlleU.
>
>If over-policing were a problem, wouldn't you expect lower rates of crime in predominantly black communities? The opposite is true and most poor black areas are war zones. The police won't even touch certain areas which is ""under-policing"" by my definition. Black communities need a far stronger police force to create a safe environment for legitimate economic growth. If I were an entrepreneur I would prefer to open my business in an ""over-policed"" area, but that is obviously not what most of America's inner cities are. 
>
>If you are going to make the sweeping claim that state governments have racist laws on the books you will need to point out specific laws. I won't wait around for that because those laws do not exist in 2017. Find me the brilliant minds on the left who argue these points, I can't seem to find any. Take Sam Harris who is one of the more brilliant people on the left, even he has refuted the claims of BLM and much of the lefts modern insane rhetoric.

I wonder how many that couldn't bother to care about ~2000-10000 active duty transgender military personnel found room in their heart to care about just 4 people dying in an embassy in Libya.

Funny, how the lives of thousands of transgender individuals don't seem to matter at all to conservatives, yet the lives of the 4 Americans lost at Benghazi did.  I wonder if they'll be inviting the moms of people affected by this to the RNC in 2020.

2927;;928;;pannerin;"It hurts to see so many people stuck in conservative echo chambers  so uninformed about the neutral and positive impact transgender men and women serving produce. You would be embarrassed to know that conservative think tanks have come to similar positive and neutral conclusions about their service. And it is striking, the lack of anger over being blindly manipulated by the people around Donald Trump who have misrepresented the facts to the President, making moves that actively hurt the American military and the stature of America to the world, just so that a distraction can be made from the continuing failures to improve on Obamacare and the unprecedented low approval ratings of the current administration. 

To actively harm good men and women serving in America's military, the military itself, and the interests of America towards the larger world is simply evil. It is sad that conservatives have been completely ignorant to the evil that is being done to deceive the American people.

It's sad to see conservatism being exploited by your current representatives. We have been led to believe that the poor rural white voters made Trump a reality, instead of looking at the 1 million voters who voted Trump in strategic electoral boundaries and states. Yet they have been lied to that their jobs would ever come back, that anything positive about the economy happening right now would lead to jobs in their communities. It's positively evil that painful reskilling, relocating and telework solutions have failed to emerge from the Republican party, which has chosen to fail at fixing healthcare. 

In fact, it's funny that trickle-down economics would prove to fail for poor, rural, white conservatives. Any economic growth happening to America would never reach small towns and communities who fail to transform their mentalities into facing the realities of a world that's only getting flatter. And conservatives are the ones standing for free trade so businesses can prosper, leading to jobs for all. It's sad whenever people fall into hypocrisy. 

Does it feel like a win for conservatism when people vote Republican based on lies that would never be fulfilled? Whether it's jobs coming back, climate change going to be stopped without cutting carbon emissions, or a return to the days where you wouldn't see dangerous and unsavoury people appearing in your towns and televisions.

The average reduction was from 30 percent pretreatment to 8 percent post treatment. ...

* [UK study](http://www.gires.org.uk/assets/Medpro-Assets/trans_mh_study.pdf): ""Suicidal ideation and actual attempts reduced after transition, with 63% thinking about or attempting suicide more before they transitioned and only 3% thinking about or attempting suicide more post-transition. 7% found that this increased during transition, which has implications for the support provided to those undergoing these processes (N=316).""

* [De Cuypere, et al., 2006](http://linkinghub.elsevier.com/retrieve/pii/S1158136006000491?via=sd&cc=y): Rate of suicide attempts dropped dramatically from 29.3 percent to 5.1 percent after receiving medical and surgical treatment among Dutch patients treated from 1986-2001.

* [Dr. Ryan Gorton](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/3219066): “In a cross-sectional study of 141 transgender patients, Kuiper and Cohen-Kittenis found that after medical intervention and treatments, suicide fell from 19 percent to zero percent in transgender men and from 24 percent to 6 percent in transgender women.)”

2) For starters, the therapeutic effect of transition depends on social support. It isn't enough that a person starts presenting as the correct gender; society needs to accept them as such. That's why suicide rates spike among transgender students denied access to the correct restrooms. 

3) A good chunk of suicides are the result of bullying or other forms of being ostracized, including discrimination in employment.

4) The history of bullying throughout school combined with discrimination in employment renders trans people among the most persistently impoverished in the country. Financial stresses also impact suicide risk.

2957;;958;;MAGGAllin;"Just curious what the feeling is on the statement and research by Dr. McHugh (Johns Hopkins). He believes transgender ppl to have a mental illness similar to anorexia: Anorexics feel they are fat even though the objective and measurable reality shows that they are underweight and many times dangerously so. Transgendered people feel that they are the opposite gender, even though objective and measurable variables (e.g. DNA make-up, male/female sex organs) show what their gender is unmistakably.

Are we not then encouraging/enabling someone with mental illness when we agree to administer sex hormones or do sex change operations? How is this different from taking someone who is a sociopath with homicidal tendencies and giving them weapons and helping them to pick out a victim?

Or do you entirely discount the professional opinion of a doctor who has many years of experience working with transgendered ppl? How do you explain the fact that suicide rates among the transgendered are so much higher; even those who have had gender re-assignment? Is it reasonable to think this is due to underlying mental illness, i.e., transgender(ism)?

Is it not child abuse for a mother to allow a child who ""feels"" they are the opposite gender to undergo hormone therapy? It is well known that a persons mind isn't fully mature until they're into their 20s. Should teenagers who are not even old enough legally drive be encouraged/allowed to make such decisions about something so important?

McHugh is a quack that has professionally humiliated himself with views that are the medical equivalent of creationism. The only reason he still has a job is because he's old. Few people want to work with him, and no one other than right wing Christians will publish with him because he's *so bad* at data abstraction.


In addition to his views (views that are actively opposed by the medical community), he thinks being gay is a mental disorder. 

He also thinks the Catholic Church sex abuse scandal wasn't a cover up and had more to do with gay people.

2963;;964;;Transthrowahoy;"Alright so we all know what this is going to be about. First off; i served four years in the australian military, im a trans woman and im going to rant. Enjoy.

I've been seeing this plastered all up and down my facebook feed and of course ive gone anywhere from seeing arguments about the cost, mental illness, surgeries and bigotry. Its pretty intense out there currently.

But I've got a few points of my own to make, and I'm a tad confused. 

One; I don't think Trumps Trans Ban is about money.

Why? Let's have a look at some figures. In an analysis, wide and varying numbers of the VA budget have been shown to be several numbers viagara and erectile dysfunction - some 40 million and 80 million respectively. But, the cost of transgender health provision will be somewhere in the figures of 2.5 million to 8.5 million per year - disrupting a negligible amount of a military budget that is twice the combined power of many countries after it.

But we aren't talking just about surgery here, we are talking about HRT aswell - testosterone, estrogen, progesterone, spironolactone. Mostly, these drugs costs about $60/month in australia - more in the US due to non public health care. But that shouldn't alarm me more than the drinking habits of soldiers.

In december 2016, it was estimated in a survey that 43% of active duty members were binge drinkers - 67% of those were between 17-25. How much would binge drinking cost the US military? What would be the medical bill for young testosterone pumped men going out and finding trouble on a weekend? Well, it turns out that on average 11,982 service members (that's nearly the full amount of the 15,500 trans members in the US military) need to undergo alcohol reeducation a year- but are we looking at banning alcohol or discharging those members? Where is the storm about alcohol? Why isn't that being banned? How much is the US government paying for soldiers to drink every weekend? Why is binge drinking a more acceptable use of payment than allowing soldiers to purchase hormone replacement therapy? 

Two; Since when, have i been more at risk to be a danger behind a gun because I'm trans?

3 people a day. 3 people a day. Thats the current statistic for police shootings in america - alright, but lets straighten that out; there's no saying how many are criminals and how many are justified and etc etc.  And also, thankyou to our men and women keeping us safe - but seriously, apart from Kristin Beck, who was a SEAL that took part in the Bin Laden raid (god she is a national treasure) how many times do we hear about a trans person shooting someone? Its the same thing with the bathroom problem; there are roughly 700,000 transgender Americans- if being transgender puts the person in the wake of being a pervert, a pedophile, a sex criminal, why aren't we hearing about trans people abusing people in bathrooms? Why isnt it a larger issue? Where are all the headlines about people being assaulted in bathrooms by trans people? Where are they?

Hint; they arent there - trans people are like spiders. We are more afraid of cis people than they are of us. Its the same thing with mental illness and being trans; there is no link between pedophilia, sex crime and mental illness and being transgender. None.

Three; And why is wanting medical treatment an issue anyway? 

Lets think about this  - because this is something im seeing; people dont want me in the military because they are worried that the fact i want to get SRS means im obviously very, very unstable. 

No. The reason i want to get SRS is to be rid of an appendage that doesnt suit my body anymore- on anti androgens, it becomes more difficult to achieve and maintain an errection. Your penis may or may not become something of a useless appendage, which is reason enough to have it surgically altered, not counting dysphoria. 

And no; i actually cant be under the influence of mental incapacity when i elect for SRS. Why? Because i have to visit a psychiatrist who had to assess that i am under no mental duress that prevents me from thinking clearly about the decision and preventing it from being an informed and rational medical choice. 

Four; Being transgender isnt a social experiment. 

Neither is gay. Or black. Or smart. Or allowing the infantry to mix with the non apes or whatever. Let's put it this way; if trans people can use the bathroom of their choice, there won't need to be excessive bathroom schemes - again; most trans people are downright terrified of cis people. We seriously fucking are. We will avoid public bathrooms all together most of the time. All we want; to go use the bathroom in peace and not be noticed doing so. Its fucking terrifying. Please, for the love of god just ignore us.


Its bedazzled and really thrown me - i really dont get it; why do people hate me so much? What have i literally done to make people so fucking outraged by my existence? What have any of my brothers and sisters done to deserve this?

I am NOT a pedophile, a basket case or anything else - im no more a threat to society than say, an egomaniac in control of the most powerful country on earth.";370;1.0;Megathread: Trump Announces Ban on Transgender Military Service;https://www.reddit.com/r/politics/comments/6pogx7/megathread_trump_announces_ban_on_transgender/;1

2985;;986;;xbettel;"The fucking wall. 

> House Republicans were planning to pass a spending bill stacked with his campaign promises, including money to build his border wall with Mexico.

> But an internal House Republican fight over transgender troops was threatening to blow up the bill. And House GOP insiders feared they might not have the votes to pass the legislation because defense hawks wanted a ban on Pentagon-funded sex reassignment operations — something GOP leaders wouldn’t give them.

> They turned to Trump, who didn’t hesitate. In the flash of a tweet, he announced that transgender troops would be banned altogether.

> Trump’s sudden decision was, in part, a last-ditch attempt to save a House proposal full of his campaign promises that was on the verge of defeat, numerous congressional and White House sources said.

I'm sure there are schizophrenics who could possibly serve without problems, but the military doesn't accept them.  There are probably diabetics who could serve as well.  It is not worth the risks, hassle and expense.  I'm sure there are trans-species people who could potentially serve.  The point is that it's not the military's job to accommodate their mental delusions.  The military's job is not to be an all-inclusive drum circle.  The military's job is to be a disciplined cohesive well oiled machine.
